\label{sec:future}

We would ultimately like to extend the change descriptor APIs into
userspace, allowing applications like database servers to exactly
specify data dependencies rather than using fsync() or similar calls
to force full syncs before writing order-sensitive data. Userspace
change descriptors could improve both the performance and correctness
of applications requiring complicated consistency semantics. Though
there are many issues to consider when extending change descriptors
outside of file server. For instance, we need to prevent misbehaving
or malicious applications from setting up dependencies such that
certain change descriptors stay in the system indefinitely. We also
plan to study the performance and memory overhead implications of
change descriptors. While we believe these changes will not be
substantive, given the speed differences between memory and disk,
we will like to better evaluate our implementation to minimize the
impact of change descriptors on system performance. In addition, we
plan to implement an ext3-like file system and a transactional file
system to demonstrate the utility of change descriptors in KudOS.
