\section*{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

We would ultimately like to extend the change descriptor APIs into
user space, allowing applications like database servers to
specify minimal and precise data dependencies for order-sensitive data.
Application-defined
change descriptors could improve the performance and correctness
of applications requiring complicated consistency semantics, although
there are many issues to consider;
for instance, we must prevent misbehaving
or malicious applications from creating excessive numbers of change
descriptors, or setting up dependencies such that certain change
descriptors stay in the system indefinitely.

We also plan to study change descriptors' performance and memory overhead
implications.
While we believe end-to-end disk performance will
remain similar to native implementations of soft updates and journaling,
we
would like to better evaluate our implementation to minimize the impact
of change descriptors on system performance. %% Currently, we do not have
%% any performance numbers because we implemented KudOS in the context of
%% a new operating system and we lack the necessary infrastructure.
%% (For example, we do not have an IDE DMA device driver yet.)
In addition, we plan to implement an ext3-like file system and a
transactional file system to demonstrate the utility of change
descriptors and modules in KudOS.
