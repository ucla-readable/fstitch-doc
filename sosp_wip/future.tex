\section*{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

We would ultimately like to extend the change descriptor APIs into
userspace, allowing applications like database servers to exactly
specify data dependencies rather than using fsync() or similar calls
to force full syncs before writing order-sensitive data. Userspace
change descriptors could improve both the performance and correctness
of applications requiring complicated consistency semantics. We also
plan to study change descriptors' performance and memory overhead
implications. While we believe these changes will not be substantive,
given the speed differences between memory and disk, issues such as
quadratic memory use for file deletion are future work.
