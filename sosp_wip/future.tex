One exciting feature we would ultimately like to add is the extension of the
change descriptor APIs into userspace, so that applications like database
servers can specify exactly what data they need written before what other data,
rather than using fsync() or similar calls to force a full sync before writing
order-sensitive data. This could improve both the performance and correctness of
applications requiring complicated consistency semantics.
