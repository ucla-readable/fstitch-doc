\section*{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

We would ultimately like to extend the change descriptor APIs into
userspace, allowing applications like database servers to exactly
specify data dependencies rather than using fsync() or similar calls
to force full syncs before writing order-sensitive data. Userspace
change descriptors could improve both the performance and correctness
of applications requiring complicated consistency semantics, though
there are many issues to consider when extending change descriptors
outside of file server. For instance, we need to prevent misbehaving
or malicious applications from creating excessive numbers of change
descriptors, or setting up dependencies such that certain change
descriptors stay in the system indefinitely.

We also plan to study the performance and memory overhead implications
of change descriptors. While we believe the differences will not be
substantial, given the speed differences between memory and disks, we
would like to better evaluate our implementation to minimize the impact
of change descriptors on system performance. Currently, we do not have
any performance numbers because we implemented KudOS in the context of
a new operating system and we lack the necessary infrastructure.
(For example, we do not have an IDE DMA device driver yet.)
In addition, we plan to implement an ext3-like file system and a
transactional file system to demonstrate the utility of change
descriptors and modules in KudOS.
