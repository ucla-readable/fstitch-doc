\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Despite the recent proliferation of advanced filesystem consistency features,
like journalling and soft updates~\cite{ganger00soft}, the software which
implements these features remains largely inflexible and difficult to reason
about. It is generally tied to a particular filesystem, and can neither be
reused in another filesystem nor adapted to allow even slightly different
semantics without significant engineering effort. To address this problem, we
propose a new system called the KudOS File Server Architecture which introduces
two significant changes to traditional designs. First, we introduce a mechanism
for explicitly representing changes to disk blocks, and the dependencies among
those changes necessary to implement various consistency semantics. Second, we
decompose the filesystem software into small modules and add a new interface
type between the block device interface and the abstract filesystem interface.
This interface separates the low-level specification of a filesystem's on-disk
layout from higher-level filesystem-independent code which operates only
abstractly on disk structures.

We have implemented a mostly-complete, functional prototype of the KFS
Architecture. In our prototype, these two changes greatly increase the
flexibility of standard consistency features, allowing our journalling module to
automatically add journalling to any filesystem. They also support the
implementation of many other possible definitions of filesystem consistency,
which in the future we hope will be userspace-specified. Finally, the module
system combined with the dependency tracking mechanism allows some interesting
new interactions, such as correct consistency on RAID over loopback devices.
