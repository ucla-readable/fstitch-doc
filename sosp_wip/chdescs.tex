The ability to revert and re-apply change descriptors is inspired by the soft
updates system in BSD's FFS~\cite{ganger00soft}, but it is generalized so that
it is not specific to any particular filesystem. A slightly simplified version
of the change descriptor structure is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:chdesc}. Change
descriptors also allow any module in the system to inspect and even modify the
changes that other modules are making.

\begin{figure}
\begin{verbatim}
struct chdesc {
    BD_t * owner;
    bdesc_t * block;
    enum {BIT, BYTE, NOOP} type;
    union {
        struct {
            uint16_t offset;
            uint32_t xor;
        } bit;
        struct {
            uint16_t offset, length;
            uint8_t * data;
        } byte;
    };
    struct chdesc * dependencies[];
};
\end{verbatim}

Soft updates, journalling, and many application-specific consistency models all
correspond to different change descriptor arrangements.
%
Block data is almost secondary to the chdescs from the point of view of the file
system server -- chdescs are what really move around in the system.
%
This concept allows some interesting configurations of
modules as well as very simple implementations of traditionally complicated
features. For instance, journalling is implemented as a single block device
module, and it can automatically add journalling -- even metadata-only
journalling -- to {\it any} LFS filesystem. Other block device layering systems,
like GEOM~\cite{geom}, would need special hooks into filesystem code in order to
get the necessary hints (i.e. what is metadata and what is not) to do
metadata-only journalling. Change descriptors and the LFS interface division
allow us to do this automatically.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=80pt]{fig/whatevs_3}
  \caption{\label{fig:softupdates} Soft updates change descriptor graph.}{Four
  change descriptors describe the dependencies for adding a newly allocated
  block to an inode. Writing the new block pointer to an inode ($BP$) depends
  on initializing the block ($ZB$) and updating the free block map ($AB$).
  Updating the size of the inode ($US$) depends on writing the block pointer
  ($BP$).
}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=200pt]{fig/whatevs_2}
  \caption{\label{fig:journal} Journal change descriptor graph.}{The original
  four change descriptors from Figure~\ref{fig:softupdates} are made to depend
  on a journal commit record, which depends on copies ($ZB_j$, $AB_j$, $BP_j$,
  and $US_j$) of the original change descriptors being written to the journal. A
  commit record cancellation depends on the original change descriptors. The
  empty circles are ``NOOP'' change descriptors which have no associated block
  data.
}
\end{figure}

For many complex operations, like RAID or journalling, the chdesc graph is
changed in specific ways which can be broken down into sequences of simple graph
transformations. For example, in the (mirroring) RAID module it is necessary to
duplicate a change descriptor, including all its dependents and dependencies. We
expect that after implementing a relatively small number of more complex modules
(we have only implemented the two mentioned), we will have seen similarities in
many of the transformations and will have built up a fairly complete library of
common transformation functions.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=200pt]{rollback_sequence}
  \caption{\label{fig:rollback} Rolling back change descriptors.}{Although no
  cycles are allowed in change descriptor graphs, cycles can exist at the block
  level which require some change descriptors to be rolled back in order to
  write the blocks. Here the squares are blocks, and dotted circles are rolled
  back change descriptors.
