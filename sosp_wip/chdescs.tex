\section*{Change Descriptors}
\label{sec:chdescs}

Each in-memory modification to a cached disk block in KudOS has an associated
change descriptor.
%
Different change types correspond to different forms of change descriptors;
the change descriptor for a flipped bit---such as in a free-block
bitmap---contains an offset and mask, while larger changes contain an
offset, a length, and the new data.
%
The change descriptor's dependencies point to other change descriptors that
must precede it to stable storage.
%
A change descriptor can be applied or reverted to switch the cached block's
state between old and new as necessary.
%
Each change descriptor applies to exactly one block.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:chdesc} gives
a simplified version of the structure. The ability to revert and
re-apply change descriptors is inspired by the soft updates system in
BSD's FFS~\cite{ganger00soft}, but generalized so that it is not
specific to any particular file system.

When a KudOS module first generates change descriptors to write to the disk, it
specifies write ordering requirements similar to those of soft updates. For
example, Figure~\ref{fig:softupdates} depicts change descriptors that allocate
and add a new block to an inode.
%
The module passes these change descriptors to another module closer to
the disk.  This second module can inspect, delay, and even modify them before
passing them on further.
%
For instance, the write-back cache module holds on to blocks and their change
descriptors instead of forwarding them immediately.
%
When evicting a block and associated change descriptors, the write-back
cache enforces an order consistent with the change descriptor dependency
information.

  including the dependencies for adding a newly allocated block to an
  inode. Writing the new block pointer to an inode (Attach) depends on
  initializing the block (Clear) and updating the free block map (Alloc).
  Updating the size of the inode (Size) depends on writing the block
  pointer.}
\end{figure}

Soft updates, journalling, and many application-specific consistency models all
correspond to different change descriptor arrangements, so these features can be
added to the system as modules which appropriately connect or reconnect the
change descriptors.
%
For example, the change descriptors in Figure~\ref{fig:softupdates} can be
transformed to provide journalling semantics. The original four change
descriptors are modified to depend on a journal commit record, which
depends on blocks journalling the changes. Once the actual changes are
committed, the journal record is marked as completed.
Figure~\ref{fig:journal} shows these transformed change descriptors.
%
This single journalling module can attach to any file system module;
it performs transformations incrementally as the change descriptors
are generated.

    change in Figure~\ref{fig:softupdates}. Empty circles are
    ``NOOP'' change descriptors with no associated block data.}

% FIXME Shorten this
Further, by changing our journal module to include only change descriptors which
modify file system metadata in its transformation, we could even obtain
metadata-only journalling. Which change descriptors represent metadata is
already known because of the LFS interface division (described in the next
section), so this is not difficult---the only challenge is in making sure that
the non-metadata change descriptors do not overwrite newly freed blocks before
the transactions freeing them are committed. Other block device layering
systems, like GEOM~\cite{geom} or JBD in Linux, would or do need special hooks
into file system code in order to get the necessary hints (i.e.  what is
metadata and what is not) to do metadata-only journalling. Change descriptors
and the LFS interface allow us to do this automatically.

% FIXME Shorten this?
Change descriptors also allow dependency information to be maintained across
boundaries that might otherwise lose that information, like loopback devices or
RAID. The consistency requirements of file systems mounted using loopback
devices can easily be respected even if the file system containing the image
doesn't use any consistency features, because the change descriptors
convey these requirements across the loopback device. Similarly, when using
RAID, the change descriptors are modified so that as they move toward different
disks, maintaining their write-ordering requirements.
