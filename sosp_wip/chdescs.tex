\section*{Change Descriptors}
\label{sec:chdescs}

In KudOS, change descriptors represent the in-memory modifications to
disk blocks. For example, a change to a bitmap would contain a block,
offset, and bitmask. A change of many bytes is stored as a block,
offset, length, and pointer to new data. Figure~\ref{fig:chdesc} gives
a simplified version of the structure. The ability to revert and
re-apply change descriptors is inspired by the soft updates system in
BSD's FFS~\cite{ganger00soft}, but generalized so that it is not
specific to any particular file system.

            uint16_t offset;

        } bit;
        struct {
            uint16_t offset, length;
            uint8_t *data;
        } byte;
    };
    struct chdesc *dependencies[];
/* ... */ };

When a KudOS module first generates change descriptors to write to the disk, it
specifies write ordering requirements similar to those of soft updates. For
example, Figure~\ref{fig:softupdates} depicts change descriptors that allocate
and add a new block to an inode.
%
The module passes these change descriptors to another module closer to
the disk.  This module can inspect, delay, and even modify them before
passing them on further.
%
For instance, the write-back cache module holds on to blocks and their change
descriptors instead of forwarding them immediately.
%
When evicting a block and associated change descriptors, the write-back
cache enforces an order consistent with the change descriptor dependency
information.

  \caption{\label{fig:softupdates} Soft updates change descriptor graph,
  including the dependencies for adding a newly allocated block to an
  inode. Writing the new block pointer to an inode (Attach) depends on
  initializing the block (Clear) and updating the free block map (Alloc).
  Updating the size of the inode (Size) depends on writing the block
  pointer.}
\end{figure}

Soft updates, journalling, and many application-specific consistency models all
correspond to different change descriptor arrangements, so these features can be
added to the system as modules which appropriately connect or reconnect the
change descriptors. For example, Figure~\ref{fig:journal} shows the change
descriptors of Figure~\ref{fig:softupdates}, transformed by the journalling
module into a journal transaction. This single module can attach to any
file system module; transformations
are performed incrementally as the change descriptors are generated.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{fig/whatevs_2}%
  \caption{\label{fig:journal} Journal change descriptor graph for the
  change in Figure~\ref{fig:softupdates}.  The original four change
  descriptors depend on a journal commit record, which depends on blocks
  being written to the journal.  Once the actual changes are committed, the
  journal record is marked as completed.  Empty circles are ``NOOP'' change
  descriptors with no associated block data.  }
\end{figure}

Even metadata-only journalling is possible with this design, though our journal
module does not yet have this feature. Other block device layering systems, like
GEOM~\cite{geom} or JBD in Linux, would or do need special hooks into file system
code in order to get the necessary hints (i.e. what is metadata and what is not)
to do metadata-only journalling. Change descriptors (and the LFS interface
division described in the next section) allow us to do this automatically.

With change descriptors,
dependency information can be maintained even across boundaries that might
otherwise lose that information, like loopback devices or RAID. With KudOS,
consistency requirements of file systems mounted using loopback devices can
easily be respected even though the file system containing the loopback image
file may not itself use any consistency features. Similarly, when using RAID,
the change descriptors can be modified so that as they part ways in the RAID
module toward different disks, their write-ordering requirements are still
maintained and ultimately satisfied.

%  cycles are allowed in change descriptor graphs, cycles can exist at the block
%  level which require some change descriptors to be rolled back in order to
%  write the blocks. Here the squares are disk blocks, and dotted circles are
%  rolled back change descriptors. Check marks indicate committed change
%  descriptors.
