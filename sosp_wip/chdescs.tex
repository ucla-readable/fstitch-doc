\section*{Change Descriptors}
\label{sec:chdescs}

The ability to revert and re-apply change descriptors is inspired by the soft
updates system in BSD's FFS~\cite{ganger00soft}, but it is generalized so that
it is not specific to any particular filesystem. A simplified version of the
change descriptor structure is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:chdesc}.

\begin{figure}
{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
struct chdesc {
    BD_t *owner;
    bdesc_t *block;
    enum {BIT, BYTE, NOOP} type;
    union {
        struct {
            uint16_t offset;
            uint32_t xor;
        } bit;
        struct {
            uint16_t offset, length;
            uint8_t *data;
        } byte;
    };
    struct chdesc *dependencies[];
};
\end{verbatim}
}

\end{figure}

A KudOS module first generates change descriptors specifying order
requirements similar to soft updates'. For example,
Figure~\ref{fig:softupdates} depicts change descriptors that allocate
and add an additional block to an inode.
%
The module passes these change descriptors to another module in the
direction of the disk, which can inspect and even modify them before
passing them on.
%
For example, the write-back cache module holds onto blocks and their
change descriptors.
%
When a block must be evicted, it makes sure to pass change descriptors
toward the disk in an order consistent with the change descriptor
dependency information.

Soft updates, journalling, and many application-specific consistency
models all correspond to different change descriptor arrangements, so
these features can be added to the system (and to any filesystem) as
modules which appropriately connect or reconnect the change
descriptors. For example, we have implemented journalling as a single
block device module, to which any filesystem module can be
attached. Even metadata-only journalling is possible with this design,
though our module does not yet have this feature.  Other block device
layering systems, like GEOM~\cite{geom} or JBD in Linux, would or do
need special hooks into filesystem code in order to get the necessary
hints (i.e. what is metadata and what is not) to do metadata-only
journalling. Change descriptors (and the LFS interface division
described in the next section) allow us to do this automatically.

\begin{figure}[b]

  \includegraphics[width=92pt]{fig/whatevs_3}%
  \caption{\label{fig:softupdates} Soft updates change descriptor graph,
  including the dependencies for adding a newly allocated block to an
  inode. Writing the new block pointer to an inode (Attach) depends on
  initializing the block (Clear) and updating the free block map (Alloc).
  Updating the size of the inode (Size) depends on writing the block
  pointer.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{fig/whatevs_2}%
  \caption{\label{fig:journal} Journal change descriptor graph for the
  change in Figure~\ref{fig:softupdates}.  The original four change
  descriptors depend on a journal commit record, which depends on blocks
  being written to the journal.  Once the actual changes are committed, the
  journal record is marked as completed.  Empty circles are ``NOOP'' change
  descriptors with no associated block data.  }
\end{figure}

For many complex operations, like RAID or journalling, the chdesc graph is
changed in specific ways which can be broken down into sequences of simple graph
transformations. For example, in the (mirroring) RAID module it is necessary to
duplicate a change descriptor, including all its dependents and dependencies.



\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=200pt]{rollback_sequence}
  \caption{\label{fig:rollback} Rolling back change descriptors. Although no
  cycles are allowed in change descriptor graphs, cycles can exist at the block
  level which require some change descriptors to be rolled back in order to
  write the blocks. Here the squares are disk blocks, and dotted circles are
  rolled back change descriptors. Check marks indicate committed change
  descriptors.
