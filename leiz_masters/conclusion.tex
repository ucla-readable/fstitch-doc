\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Traditional approaches for file system development are tedious and oftentimes
non-intuitive. Robust consistency mechanism are especially hard to reason
about. In \Kudos, we attack the problems by introducing new interfaces to
separate file functionality into manageable components. Using the change
descriptor abstraction, we give \modules\ a way to explicitly indicate write
dependency orderings. We demonstrate, through our file system implementation,
it is possible to construct and enhance complex file systems like UFS in a
modular fashion. We hope to improve our software further by adding more
features, increasing performance, and developing even better interfaces.
