\section {Kudos}
\label{sec:kudos}

The Kudos File System Architecture (Kudos) is a modular system designed for
the flexibility, extensibility, and readability of file systems and related
software. Being a \emph{file system architecture}, \Kudos\ encompasses more
than just the file system. To interface with userland, \Kudos\ implements a
VFS layer.
From there on, \Kudos\ has its own file system, cache, and block devices.
Additionally, \Kudos\ introduces a new concept we call
\emph{change descriptors}.
To support them, we have implemented libraries to create, manipulate, and use
change descriptors. Our software has been ported to Linux, both as a kernel
module, and as a userland server connected via FUSE. The file server is also
an integral part of a JOS-derived experimental operating system that shares
the \Kudos\ name.
