File system development and consistency protocol implementation can be a
daunting experience. We argue it is possible to improve the development
process using better software engineering techniques. In our approach, we take
the disk subsystem, and break it down into fine-grained components. We also
introduce a new data dependency structure called the
\emph{change descriptor}. In the Kudos File System Architecture, I use
these ideas to implement the Unix File System, with consistency features
such as soft updates and journaling. By leveraging modularity and proper
abstractions, my implementation provides more simplicity, clarity, and
separation, while maintaining correctness, and offering acceptable performance.
