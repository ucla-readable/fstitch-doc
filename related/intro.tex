\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This short paper outlines related work that we have referred to during
the design of the KudOS File System module structure and the semantics
associated with our data structures. Our main goal was to be able to
break the disk and filesystem subsystem of KudOS into small modules
that could be (easily) arranged in many different ways to acheive as
many different working configurations as possible, while making it
easy both to write new modules and to use and understand existing
modules. We wanted to support as much flexibility in writing new
modules as possible, and tried to avoid making limiting decisions
wherever possible. To this end, we considered several other works that
change the way filesystems operate in unique ways, to make sure our
design would not be incompatible with these ideas.
