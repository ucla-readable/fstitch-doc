Most certainly
- Update the contact address to featherstitch@lists.ucla.edu
  (can we rename the kudos list?) (are we ok with providing it as text?)
- Post source access

Maybe?
- Create a nice, logoish rendering of "Featherstitch"?
- Use a shorter about than the SOSP07 abstract?
- Figure out what the page is missing that would make it more fun?
