One promising direction we would like to move in is to eventually extend the
change descriptor APIs into userspace, so that applications like database
servers can specify exactly what they need written before what, rather than
using fsync() or similar calls to force a full sync before writing
order-sensitive data. This could improve both the performance and correctness
of applications requiring complicated consistency semantics.
