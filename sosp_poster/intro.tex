The KudOS File Server Architecture is an experiment in increasing the
flexibility, breaking many of the existing limitations, and increasing
the understandability of file system software\footnote{We want to
  improve/scrap this first sentence}.  The KFS architecture's two most
fundamental changes are the addition of an interface layer between the
virtual file system and block device layers that operates on files at
the block level and the use of disk change descriptions and
dependencies. These two changes are responsible for componentizing and
simplfying common filesystem features, such as transparent journaling,
and supporting interesting new interactions, such as RAID over
loopback devices and userspace specified change dependencies.
