A few examples will help to illustrate the flexibility gained by using this
module system and change descriptors:

\begin{itemize}
\item \itemvspace{} {\bf Reliable Loopback Filesystem}: A journalled filesystem
  can be mounted on a loopback device connected to a file in a non-journalled
  filesystem, and chdescs forwarded through the loop device keep the journalled
  filesystem safe even though the ``host'' filesystem is not journalled.
\item \itemvspace{} {\bf RAID Over Loopback or Network Block Devices}: It is
  simple to hook up the BD modules to create RAID over loop devices, or network
  block devices. No special work is required to add this capability at all.
\item \itemvspace{} {\bf Journalling Any Filesystem}: Since journalling is
  implemented as a single BD module, it is easy to add it to any filesystem LFS
  module. The chdescs provide all the necessary information to keep the journal,
  and when UHFS is used even metadata-only journalling can be accomplished.
\item \itemvspace{} {\bf Database Server Change Descriptors}: By extending
  change descriptor APIs into userspace, applications like a database server can
  specify exactly what they need written before what, rather than using fsync()
  or similar calls to force a full sync before writing order-sensitive data.
