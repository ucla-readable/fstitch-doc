\label{sec:examples}

A few examples will help to illustrate the flexibility gained by using this
module system and change descriptors:

\begin{itemize}

\item \itemvspace{} {\bf Reliable Loopback Filesystem}: A journalled filesystem
  can be mounted on a loopback device connected to a file in a non-journalled
  filesystem, and chdescs forwarded through the loop device keep the journalled
  filesystem safe even though the ``host'' filesystem is not journalled.

\end{itemize}
