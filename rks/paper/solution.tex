\section{The Solution}
\label{sec:solution}

In this paper, we present a prototype system that attempts to address much of
the inflexibility and many of the extensibility limitations of existing file
system drivers. It works by abstracting a large amount of code common across
many file systems and reliability features, and breaking up the system into
small modules which are easier to understand than a single large driver. Extra
features can be added, mixed and matched, or changed much more easily than with
a monolithic file system driver design.

We call our system the KudOS file server. It runs in a small operating system
(also called KudOS) which was originally based on an educational exokernel
system called JOS. It follows a microkernel approach in that it is a separate
user environment (the JOS term for a process), but it could be made part of the
kernel with relatively small changes (mostly to the client interface
mechanisms).
