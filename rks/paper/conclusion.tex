\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Traditionally, file systems have been monolithic and inflexible in design. In
KudOS, we describe a componentized system where the file server consists of the
CFS, LFS, and BD layers, along with services for dependency management and
online configuration. 

We have demonstrated the power of KudOS through the use of common code and
infrastructure to implement different features. After the necessary modules were
implemented, adding extra features like journaling and RAID was relatively
painless. The system is also ripe for new features; modules are easy to
implement and can take advantage of any preexisting infrastructure in the
system.
