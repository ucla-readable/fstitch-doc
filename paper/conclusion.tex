\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Traditionally, file systems have been monolithic and inflexable in design. In
KudOS, we describe a componentized system where the file server consists of the
CFS, LFS, and BD layers, along with services for dependency management and
online configuration. We have demonstrated the power of KudOS through the
use of common code and infrastructure to implement different features, the
ability to easily extend the system with new modules, and the flexibility to
rearrange components to achieve a variety of configurations.
