Traditional filesystems are large and rigid. While they have been carefully
tuned to today's typical needs, they are difficult to modify. This makes not
only experimentation difficult, but hinders the implementation of new features.

We introduce the KudOS File Server, a componentized file system server. All the
functionality of a traditional filesystem has been broken down into
rearrangeable components. The components can be arranged to easily support
existing filesystem features, like journaling, loop back devices, etc.
Furthermore, the modular nature of the system makes it very easy to add new
features. This allows new filesystems to plug into existing functionality more
than was previously possible, thus speeding development and reducing code
duplication.
