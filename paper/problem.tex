\section{The Problem}
\label{sec:problem}

Filesystems today are an integral part of any computer system, and for many
applications like databases or web servers, the choice of filesystem can have a
dramatic impact on the resulting performance and stability of the application.
Often these performance and stability differences come from small feature
differences in the filesystem, like supporting large directory traversals
efficiently at the expense of disk space, being able to store many small files
in the same disk block, or having some sort of reliable recovery mechanism for
system crashes.

Even though this is the case, existing filesystems are generally implemented as
monolithic blocks of code that conform to the disk infrastructure used in an OS
on one side, and to the userspace filesystem interface on the other. These
modules can be tens of thousands of lines long, and are difficult to change
without understanding large amounts of code that in principle does not have
anything to do with filesystems. Furthermore, there is a lot of duplication
between different filesystems, especially in the higher-level parts of the
filesystem code that interfaces with userspace.
