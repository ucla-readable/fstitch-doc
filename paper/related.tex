\subsection{Linux JFS and ext3}

ext3 was full data journaling too until they figured out what to
do. our journaling is modeled off of ext3. ours is full only.

\subsection{BSD Soft Updates}

we made softupdates, we did it at a lower level w/ chdescs refering to
data, not with references to higher level primatives. we are the
taking the idea of rolling back block changes. theirs is more closely
tied to FFS and help the rest of the system make certain decisions,
that we would have a tough time discovering.

we are more general -- journaling is part of our system.

\subsection{Stackable File Systems}

we can do similar things at either the cfs or lfs layer. we allow a
lot more flexibility and we have a larger scope than just stacking
stuff.

\subsection{BSD GEOM}

they did the hot-swap that we can do w/ modules. we can't hot-swap
modules w/ state. problem for cfs moduels and some lfs ones. even bd
modules have some state (point to other bd modules). we have what we
think is important (raid thingy).

\subsection{Flux OSkit}

we replaced parts. but smaller, more manageable than they provided. we
did some things lke they did -- wrapped up the original josfs like
flux wrapped up drivers.

they weren't looking to replace or break up the basefs.
