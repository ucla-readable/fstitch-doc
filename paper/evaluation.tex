\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

show some example config graphs for su on su, journaling, journaling
to su fs. they work! show what mount does. fsck to verify.

compare to fs (faster b/c it does less)

compare to linux

Too slow, rules are hard to follow.

limitation: no memory mapping. kfs rpc client leaks memory all over
the place. modman leaks memory. not thread safe!
