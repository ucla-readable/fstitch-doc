\section{The Solution}
\label{sec:solution}

Our solution is a prototype system we call the KudOS file server. It runs in a
small operating system (also called KudOS) which was originally based on an
educational exokernel system called JOS. It follows a microkernel approach in
that it is a separate user environment (the JOS term for a process), but it
could be made part of the kernel with relatively small changes (mostly to the
client interface mechanisms).
