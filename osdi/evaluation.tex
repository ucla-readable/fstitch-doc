\section {Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

We will evaluate our prototype implementation of \Kudos\ in two ways: first, we
show that the overall performance is within reason, even though it is slower
than Linux by a nontrivial amount. We justify this difference, and argue that it
can be improved substantially. Second, we show specific block write orderings in
a variety of situations, demonstrating the effect and utility of \opgroups\ and
the potential for them to improve the efficiency of applications using them.

\subsection {Overall Performance}
\begin{itemize}
\item Show performance is not \emph{that} bad (macrobenchmarks)
\item Argue performance can be improved (see \S\ref{sec:discussion})
\end{itemize}

\subsection {Block Writes}
Demonstrate numbers of writes vs. BSD with and without soft updates.

\subsection {UW IMAP Case Study}
\label{sec:evaluation:uwimap}

Show fewer writes in UW IMAP using \opgroups\ (see \S\ref{sec:opgroup:uwimap})
