\section {Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

It doesn't suck that much. Plus it is really neat.

Ideas:
\begin{itemize}
\item Demonstrate numbers of writes vs. BSD
\item Show fewer writes in UW-IMAP using \opgroups (see \S\ref{sec:opgroup:uwimap})
\item Show performance is not \emph{that} bad (macrobenchmarks)
\item Argue performance can be improved (see \S\ref{sec:future})
\end{itemize}
