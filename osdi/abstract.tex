% The abstract will call them "change descriptors" always.
We propose a file system implementation architecture, called \emph{\Kudos},
where \emph{change descriptor} structures represent any and all changes to
stable storage.
%
%%  File systems generate change descriptors for all writes, then
%% send them to block devices for eventual commit. Explicit dependencies between
%% change descriptors let \Kudos\ \modules\ preserve necessary file system
%% invariants without understanding the file system itself. Change descriptors can
%% implement many consistency mechanisms, including soft updates and journaling.
%
\Kudos\ is decomposed into fine-grained \modules\ which generate, consume,
forward, and manipulate change descriptors. A particular innovation of the
\module\ design is the separation of the low-level specification of on-disk
layout from higher-level file system-independent code, which operates on
abstract disk structures. Our journaling \module\ can automatically add
journaling to any file system, and combinations of simple \modules\ can support,
for example, correct consistency on RAID over loop-back devices.

Finally, a new interface between \Kudos\ and user applications allows them to
have some direct control over change descriptors. We have used this interface to
improve the UW IMAP server, removing inefficient and unnecessary calls to
\texttt{fsync()} while preserving the integrity of mail messages.

We have implemented \Kudos\ as both a Linux kernel module and a FUSE~\cite{fuse}
userspace file system server. INSERT BRIEF PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS HERE.
