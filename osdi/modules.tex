\section{\Modules}
\label{sec:modules}

A complete \Kudos\ configuration is composed of many different \modules. In this
section, we will describe some of the ones which contribute most to the \chdesc\
related functionality of the system. There are several other block device
\modules, like the write-through cache, partitioner, memory block device, and
loopback block device, which perform more traditional functions, and a handful
of CFS and LFS \modules\ like the block device file system \module, file hiding
\module\, and whole disk access \module, which demonstrate various other
abilities of the \module\ system.
