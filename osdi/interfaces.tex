\subsection {\Module\ Interfaces}
\label{sec:design:interfaces}

A complete \Kudos\ configuration is composed of many \modules. By breaking file
system code into small, stackable \modules, we are able to significantly
increase code reuse. More importantly, new \modules\ are simple to write, and
can implement a variety of new features for the file system. Finally, by
changing the arrangement of the \modules, a broad range of behaviors can be
implemented -- and it is easy to tell what behavior a given arrangement will
give just by looking at the connections between the \modules.

Stackable \module\ software for file systems is not a new idea (for instance, it
has been proposed as early as 1994 in \cite{heidemann94stackable}), but previous
work like FiST~\cite{zadok00fist} or GEOM~\cite{geom} generally focuses on a
small portion of the system and thus restrict both what a \module\ can do and
how \modules\ can be arranged. FiST, for instance, does not provide a way to
deal with structures on the disk directly -- it provides only ``wrapper''
functionality around existing file systems. GEOM, on the other hand, deals only
with the block device layer, and has no way to work with the file systems stored
on those block devices. Neither has a formal way of specifying or honoring
complex write-ordering information, which is what \chdescs\ in \Kudos\ provide.

\Kudos\ has three major types of \modules. First, there are block device
(``BD'') \modules, which have a fairly conventional interface. Next, there are
``common file system'' (``CFS'') \modules, which have an interface similar to
VFS~\cite{kleiman86vnodes}. In traditional systems, a CFS-like \module\ would be
connected directly to a BD-like \module\ in order to set up a file system to be
ready for mounting. In \Kudos, however, there is an intermediate interface which
can be used between block devices and the high-level CFS interface: the
``low-level file system'' (``LFS'') interface. LFS helps to divide file system
implementations into common (reusable) code and file system specific code. In
\Kudos, all three interfaces can be combined in many ways -- a departure from
other stackable \module\ systems, which generally allow stacking only a single
interface.

The LFS interface has functions to allocate blocks, add blocks to files,
allocate file names, and other file system micro-ops. A \module\ implementing
the LFS interface should define how bits are laid out on the disk, but doesn't
have to know how to combine the micro-ops into larger, more familiar file system
operations. A generic CFS-to-LFS \module\ decomposes the larger file write,
read, append, and other standard operations into LFS micro-ops. This one
\module\ can be used with many different LFS \modules\ implementing different
file systems. (There is also a generic VFS-to-CFS layer, which has two
implementations: one for the Linux kernel module, and one for the
FUSE~\cite{fuse} version. See \S\ref{sec:implementation} for details.)

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:kfs-graph} shows a contrived example taking advantage of the LFS
interface and \chdescs. A file system image is mounted with an external journal,
both of which are loop devices on the root file system, which uses soft updates.
The journaled file system's ordering requirements are sent through the loop
device as \chdescs, allowing dependency information to be maintained across
boundaries that might otherwise lose that information. In contrast, without
\chdescs\ and the ability to forward \chdescs\ through loop devices, BSD cannot
express soft updates' consistency requirements through loop-back file systems.
