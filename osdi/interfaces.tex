\subsection {\Module\ Interfaces}
\label{sec:design:interfaces}

A complete \Kudos\ configuration is composed of many \modules. By breaking file
system code into small, stackable \modules, we are able to significantly
increase code reuse. More importantly, new \modules\ are simple to write, and
can implement a variety of new features for the file system. Finally, by
changing the arrangement of the \modules, a broad range of behaviors can be
implemented -- and it is easy to tell what behavior a given arrangement will
give just by looking at the connections between the \modules.

\Kudos\ has three major types of \modules. First, there are block device
(``BD'') \modules, which have a fairly conventional interface. Next, there are
``common file system'' (``CFS'') \modules, which have an interface similar to
VFS~\cite{kleiman86vnodes}. In traditional systems, a CFS-like \module\ would be
connected directly to a BD-like \module\ in order to set up a file system to be
ready for mounting. In \Kudos, however, there is an intermediate interface which
can be used between block devices and the high-level CFS interface: the
``low-level file system'' (``LFS'') interface. LFS helps to divide file system
implementations into common (reusable) code and file system specific code. In
\Kudos, all three interfaces can be combined in many ways -- a departure from
other stackable \module\ systems, which generally allow stacking only a single
interface. \Kudos\ \modules\ are implemented in C using structures of function
pointers to achieve object oriented behavior.

\end{figure}

The LFS interface (Figure~\ref{fig:lfs}) has functions to allocate blocks, add
blocks to files, allocate file names, and other file system micro-ops. A
\module\ implementing the LFS interface should define how bits are laid out on
the disk, but doesn't have to know how to combine the micro-ops into larger,
more familiar file system operations. A generic CFS-to-LFS \module\ decomposes
the larger file write, read, append, and other standard operations into LFS
micro-ops. This one \module, called the ``universal high-level file system''
or \emph{UHFS}, can be used with many different LFS \modules\ implementing
different file systems. (There is also a generic VFS-to-CFS layer, which has
two implementations: one for the Linux kernel module, and one for the
FUSE~\cite{fuse} version. See \S\ref{sec:implementation} for details.)

    file system on an IDE drive; {\it/loop} is an externally journaled
    file system on loop devices.}
  \label{fig:kfs-graph}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:kfs-graph}\todo{Show multiple WB caches? Remove the mount selector?} shows a contrived example taking advantage of the LFS
interface and \chdescs. A file system image is mounted with an external journal,
both of which are loop devices on the root file system, which uses soft updates.
The journaled file system's ordering requirements are sent through the loop
device as \chdescs, allowing dependency information to be maintained across
boundaries that might otherwise lose that information. In contrast, without
\chdescs\ and the ability to forward \chdescs\ through loop devices, BSD cannot
express soft updates' consistency requirements through loop-back file systems.
