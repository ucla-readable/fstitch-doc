How to install fuse to use unix-user kfsd:

1. Use linux 2.6.15+ with the FUSE kernel module.
   2.6.14+ comes with the FUSE module, but 2.6.15+ has features others do not.
   FUSE also comes with modules for older 2.6, linux 2.4.x, and freebsd.

2. Install the FUSE library, version 2.5.

3. Run kfsd! You can run it from kudos/obj/unixuser/kfsd/kfsd or use
   kudos/uukfsd.sh which will umount the fs when kfsd crashes.
