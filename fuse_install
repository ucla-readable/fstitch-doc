How to install fuse to use unix-user kfsd:

1. Use linux 2.6.15+ with the FUSE kernel module.
   2.6.14+ comes with the FUSE module, but 2.6.15+ has features others do not.
   FUSE also comes with modules for older 2.6, linux 2.4.x, and freebsd.

   NOTE: 2.6.15 introduced an unmount bug that we touch. You can get the
   one line patch from Al Viro's tree:
   http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/viro/bird.git;a=commitdiff;h=c3d2f2c6b7cb20ec69a9770c5244804540be077

2. Install the FUSE library, version 2.5.

3. Run kfsd! You can run it using kudos/uukfsd.sh (a script that umounts the
   filesystem if kfsd crashes) or run kfsd directly from
   kudos/obj/unixuser/kfsd/kfsd.
