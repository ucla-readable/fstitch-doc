\section{Consistency}
\label{sec:consistency}

Soft updates, journaling, and many application-specific consistency models all
correspond to different \chdesc\ arrangements, so these features can be added to
the system as \modules\ which appropriately connect or reconnect the \chdescs.
For soft updates, the \chdescs\ created by the file system \module\ must be
connected according to the rules in \cite{ganger00soft}, and the write-back
cache will take it from there. For journaling, a journal \module\ is added above
the write-back cache that rearranges the \chdescs\ to provide journaling. Other
semantics could be supported by the addition of similar modules. In this
section, we will discuss the soft updates and journaling support in \Kudos.
