% FIXME: decide how to hyphenate -related and -independent

This section describes some \Kudos\ \modules\ which contribute most to
the \chdesc\ related functionality of the system. There are several other
block device \modules, like the write-through cache, partitioner, memory
block device, and loop-back block device, which perform more traditional
functions, and a handful of CFS and LFS \modules\ like the block device
file system \module, file hiding \module, and whole disk access \module,
which demonstrate various other abilities of the \module\ system.
