\section{\Modules}
\label{sec:modules}

A complete \Kudos\ configuration is composed of many \modules, making it
in some sense a finer-grained variant of a stackable file system.
%
There are three major types of \modules.
%
Closest to the disk are block device (BD) \modules, which have a fairly
conventional block device interface with interfaces such as ``read block'' and
``flush''. 
%
Closest to the system call interface are \emph{common file system} (CFS)
\modules, which have an interface similar to VFS~\cite{kleiman86vnodes}. 
%
\Kudos\ also supports an intermediate interface between BD and CFS.
%
This \emph{low-level file system} (\LFS) interface helps divide file system
implementations into code common across block-structured file systems and
code specific to a given file system layout.
%
The \LFS\ interface has functions to allocate blocks, add blocks to files,
allocate file names, and other file system micro-operations. A \module\
implementing the \LFS\ interface defines how bits are laid out on the disk, but
doesn't have to know how to combine the micro-operations into larger, more
familiar file system operations. A generic CFS-to-\LFS\ \module\ called UHFS
(``universal high-level file system'') decomposes the larger file write, read,
append, and other standard operations into \LFS\ micro-operations. 
%
File system extensions like those often implemented by stackable file
systems would generally use the CFS interface; for example, we wrote a
simple CFS module that provides case-insensitive access to a case-sensitive
file system.
%
File system implementations, such as our ext2 and UFS implementations, use
the \LFS\ interface.


\Patches\ are explicitly part of the \LFS\ interface.
%
Every \LFS\ function that might modify the file system takes a
\texttt{\textit{patch\char`\_t **p}} argument.
%
Before the function is called, \texttt{*p} should be set to the \patch,
if any, on which the modification should depend;
%
when the function returns, \texttt{*p} will be set to some \patch\
corresponding to the modification itself.
%
(\Noop\ \patches\ allow this interface to generalize to multiple
dependencies.)
%
For example, this function is called to append a block to an \LFS\ inode
(which is called ``\verb+fdesc_t+''):

\begin{small}
\begin{alltt}
int (*append_file_block)(LFS_t *module, 
   fdesc_t *file, uint32_t block, patch_t **p);
\end{alltt}
\end{small}

\noindent
This design lets \LFS\ modules examine and modify the dependency structure.

\subsection{Loopback Device}
\label{sec:modules:loop}

The loopback device is a BD module that uses a file in an \LFS\ module as
its underlying data store. It is very similar to the device of the same
name in Linux, but with one critical difference: it is aware of \patches.
%
The loopback module preserves its file system's dependencies and forwards
them to its underlying data store.
%
As a result, the data store will honor those dependencies and preserve the
loopback file system's consistency, even if the data store would normally
provide no guarantees for consistency of file system data (e.g., it used
metadata-only journaling).

\begin{figure}[t]

  \caption{A running \Kudos\ configuration. {\it/} is a soft updated
    file system on an IDE drive; {\it/loop} is an externally journaled
    file system on loop devices.}
  \label{fig:kfs-graph}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:kfs-graph} shows an example configuration using the
loopback module.
%
A file system image is mounted with an external journal, both of
which are loopback block devices stored on the root file system (which uses
soft updates). The journaled file system's ordering requirements are sent
through the loopback module as \patches, allowing dependency information to be
maintained across boundaries that might otherwise lose that information. In
contrast, without \patches\ and the ability to forward \patches\ through
loopback devices, BSD cannot express soft updates' consistency requirements
through loopback devices. The \modules\ in Figure~\ref{fig:kfs-graph} are a
complete and working \Kudos\ configuration, and although the use of a loopback
device is somewhat contrived in the example, they are increasingly being used in
conventional operating systems. For instance, Mac OS X uses them in order to
allow users to encrypt their home directories.

\subsection{ext2 and UFS}

\Kudos\ currently has \modules\ that implement two file system types, Linux
ext2 and 4.2 BSD UFS (Unix File System, the modern incarnation of the Fast File
System~\cite{mckusick84fast}).
%
Both of these \modules\ initially generate dependencies arranged according to the
soft updates rules; other dependency arrangements are achieved by transforming these.
To the best of our knowledge, our implementation of ext2 is the first to provide
soft updates consistency guarantees.
%
%We verified that file systems generated by our modules are considered
%correct by their reference implementations on FreeBSD and Linux by mounting
%and running \emph{fsck} on \Kudos-generated disk images.

Both \modules\ are implemented at the \LFS\ interface. 
%
%% This keeps properties
%% specific to the file system (such as the on-disk format and rules governing
%% block allocation) hidden within the \module. 
%
%The \modules\ create \patches\ for all their changes to the disk and
%connect them to form subgraphs that enforce the soft updates
%rules~\cite{ganger00soft} as applied to each file system. 
%
%The UHFS \module\ is also aware of soft updates order when necessary; when
%it implements a single operation using multiple \LFS\ calls, it hooks the
%resulting \patches\ up in the correct order.
%
Unlike FreeBSD's soft updates implementation, once these modules set up the
desired dependencies for the \patches\ they create, they no longer need to
concern themselves with those \patches---the block device subsystem will track
and enforce the dependencies.

\subsection{Asynchronous writes}
\label{sec:modules:unlink}

Finally, we also wrote a trivial module that removes all dependencies from
incoming \patches, allowing the buffer cache to write blocks in any order.
%
This implements similar semantics to existing file systems like ext2 in
asynchronous write mode.
