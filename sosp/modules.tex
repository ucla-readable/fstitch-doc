\section{\Modules}
\label{sec:modules}

This section describes some \Kudos\ \modules\ which contribute most to
the \chdesc\ related functionality of the system. There are several other
block device \modules, like the write-through cache, partitioner, memory
block device, and loop-back block device, which perform more traditional
functions, and a handful of CFS and \LFS\ \modules\ like the block device
file system \module, file hiding \module, and whole disk access \module,
which demonstrate various other abilities of the \module\ system.

\subsection{Loopback Block Device}
\label{sec:modules:loop}

The loopback block device is a BD module which uses a file in an LFS module as
its underlying data store. It is very similar to the device of the same name in
Linux, however it has one critical difference. The \Kudos\ loopback device is
aware of \chdescs, and therefore when a filesystem stored on a loopback device
sets up \chdesc\ dependencies, they will be correctly forwarded to and honored
by the rest of the system.

\begin{figure}[htb]

    file system on an IDE drive; {\it/loop} is an externally journaled
    file system on loop devices.}
  \label{fig:kfs-graph}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:kfs-graph} shows an example configuration taking advantage of
this ability. A file system image is mounted with an external journal, both of
which are loopback block devices stored on the root file system, (which uses
soft updates). The journaled file system's ordering requirements are sent
through the loopback device as \chdescs, allowing dependency information to be
maintained across boundaries that might otherwise lose that information. In
contrast, without \chdescs\ and the ability to forward \chdescs\ through
loopback devices, BSD cannot express soft updates' consistency requirements
through loopback devices. The \modules\ in Figure~\ref{fig:kfs-graph} are a
complete and working \Kudos\ configuration, and although the use of a loopback
device is somewhat contrived in the example, they are increasingly being used in
conventional operating systems. For instance, Mac OS X uses them in order to
allow users to encrypt their home directories.
