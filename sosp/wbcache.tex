\subsection{Write-Back Cache}
\label{sec:modules:wbcache}

The \Kudos\ buffer cache module is called the \emph{write-back cache}.
%
Its job is twofold: first, it caches blocks in memory, and second, it
ensures that modifications are written to stable storage in an order that
preserves the in-flight safety property.
%
Modules ``below'' the write-back cache---that is, between its output
interface and the disk---can reorder block writes at will without violating
dependency orderings.
%
There can be many write-back caches in a configuration at once (for
instance, one for each block device). To a write-back cache, the complex
consistency protocols that other \modules\ want to enforce are nothing more
than sets of dependencies among \chdescs; it has no idea what consistency
protocols it is implementing, if any.
% Yet it is the \module\ that ends up doing most of the work to make sure that
% \chdescs\ are written in an acceptable order.

% Despite this, write-back caches are relatively simple; they are only slightly
% more complex than the naive implementation already suggested.
Our prototype write-back cache \module\ 
%% is little more than a front end to
%% the automatically-maintained ready \chdesc\ lists described in
%% Section~\ref{sec:patch:readylist}.
%
uses a modified FIFO policy to write dirty blocks and an LRU policy to
evict clean blocks.  (Upon being written, a dirty block becomes clean and
may then be evicted.)
%
The FIFO policy used to write blocks is modified only to preserve the
in-flight safety property: a block will not be written if none of its
\patches\ are ready to write.
%
Once the write-back cache finds a block with ready \chdescs, all other
\chdescs\ on that block are rolled back, the resulting block data is copied
and sent to the disk driver, the ready \chdescs\ are marked in-flight, and
the rolled-back \chdescs\ are rolled forward again.
%
The block itself is also marked in-flight, ensuring that the cache will not
try to write it again until the current version commits.


As a special case to aid disk performance, when the write-back cache finds
it can write block $n$, it then checks to see if block $n+1$ can be written as
well.
%
It continues writing increasing block numbers until some block is either
unwritable or not in the cache.
%
\begin{comment}
The block itself is also marked \PInfst, so that only
one version of its data will be in flight at a time. (This whole procedure is
basically the buffer cache \textit{Write block} action.)
\end{comment}
%
This simple optimization greatly improves I/O wait time, since the I/O
requests are merged and reordered in Linux's elevator scheduler.
%
Nevertheless, our profiling results indicate significant opportunities for
further optimization: for example, since the cache will write a block even
if only one of its patches is ready, it can choose to roll back
\patches\ unnecessarily when a different order would have required fewer
writes.


\begin{comment}
Each \chdesc\ on a cached block may or may not be visible to a given \module.
For example, \modules\ that respond to user requests generally view the most
current state of every block -- the block with all \chdescs\ applied. However, a
write-back cache may choose to write some \chdescs\ on a block while reverting
others, since those others currently have outstanding dependencies. In this
case, \modules\ below the write-back cache (i.e. closer to the disk) should view
those \chdescs\ in the reverted state. \Kudos\ provides a block revisioning
library function that automatically rolls back those \chdescs\ that should not
be visible at a particular \module, and then rolls them forward again after that
\module\ is done with the block.
