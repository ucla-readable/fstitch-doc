\section{Consistency Models}
\label{sec:using}

Soft updates, journaling, and other consistency models
correspond to different \chdesc\ arrangements.
%% , so these features can be added to
%% the system as \modules\ which appropriately connect or reconnect the \chdescs.
%
\Kudos's current file system \modules\ generate dependencies corresponding
to soft updates orderings by default~\cite{ganger00soft}.
%
Adding an independent journal \module\ rearranges the \chdescs\ to provide
journaling semantics;
%
for maximum speed and minimum durability, a \module\ that disconnects
\chdesc\ dependencies can be added.
%
%% Many other semantics could be supported by the addition of similar modules. In
%% this section, we will discuss how \chdescs\ are used to implement different
%% consistency semantics in \Kudos.
