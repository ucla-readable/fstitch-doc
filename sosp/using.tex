\section{Consistency Using \ChDescs}
\label{sec:using}

Soft updates, journaling, and many application-specific consistency models all
correspond to different \chdesc\ arrangements, so these features can be added to
the system as \modules\ which appropriately connect or reconnect the \chdescs.
%
File system \modules\ in \Kudos\ generate soft updates dependencies by default,
by connecting the \chdescs\ they create according to the rules
in~\cite{ganger00soft}.
%
For journaling, a journal \module\ is added to the system that rearranges the
\chdescs\ to provide journaling.
%
If no consistency is desired, a \module\ that disconnects \chdesc\ dependencies
can be used.
%
Many other semantics could be supported by the addition of similar modules. In
this section, we will discuss how \chdescs\ are used to implement different
consistency semantics in \Kudos.
