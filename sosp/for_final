Technical work we might take on after the initial submission but by the
final paper:
- metadata-only journaling
- cache syncing that does not also flush
- opgroup and file syncing that do not flush all chdescs
- more efficient cycle detection
- less stringent opgroup operations?
- improved large wb cache efficency (mainly: revision_slice_create() and revision_slice_chdesc_is_ready())
- multiple linux_bd write consistency
