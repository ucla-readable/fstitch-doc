\paragraph{Consistency}

Soft updates~\cite{ganger00soft} 
%% is one of the biggest innovations in file
%% systems in terms of
significantly lowers the overhead required to provide file system
consistency. By carefully ordering writes to disk, soft updates avoids the need
for synchronous writes to disk or duplicate writes to a journal. Soft updates
also guarantees a strong level of consistency after a crash, enough so that the
system can avoid time-consuming file system consistency checks using a utility
like \emph{fsck}. 

%% Section~\ref{sec:using:softupdate}
%% explains soft updates in greater detail.

Another approach to protecting the integrity of the file system is to write
upcoming operations to a journal first. The content and the layout of the
journal vary in each implementation, but in all cases, the system can use
the journal to play out (or roll back) the operations that did not complete
as a result of a crash. Thus, \emph{fsck} can be avoided by consulting the
journal when recovering from a crash. Section \ref{sec:using:journal}
explains journaling with \chdescs. \cite{seltzer00journaling} compares
journaling and soft updates in practice.

Customizable application-level consistency protocols have previously been
considered in the context of distributed, parallel file systems by
CAPFS~\cite{vilayannur05providing}. In such a system, enforcing an unnecessary
consistency protocol can be extremely expensive, and not providing the right
consistency protocol can cause unpredictable failures. However, this is also
true with a local file system -- and as a result, applications must use
expensive interfaces like \texttt{fsync()} when they require specific
consistency guarantees. \Kudos\ brings this sort of customizable consistency to
all applications, not just those using specialized distributed file systems.

\paragraph{Stackable File Systems}

% \cite{webber93portable}

Stackable \module\ software for file systems continues to attract active
research~\cite{rosenthal90evolving, heidemann91layered, skinner93stacking,
heidemann94filesystem,zadok99extending,
zadok00fist,wright03ncryptfs,wright06versatility}. Previous
systems like FiST~\cite{zadok00fist} or GEOM~\cite{geom} generally focus on
an individual portion of the system and thus restrict both what a \module\
can do and how \modules\ can be arranged. FiST, for instance, does not
provide a way to deal with structures on the disk directly -- it provides
only ``wrapper'' functionality around existing file
systems. %% (Wrapfs~\cite{zadok99stackable, zadok99extending} is similar.)
GEOM, on the other hand, deals only with the block device layer, and has no
way to work with the file systems stored on those block devices. Neither
has a formal way of specifying or honoring complex write-ordering
information, which is what \chdescs\ in \Kudos\ provide. We imagine that
systems like these could be adapted to work with \chdescs, giving the
benefits of both ideas.

\paragraph{Applications}

A variety of extensions to file systems have been proposed in recent work, like
the FS2 Free Space File System~\cite{huang05fs2} and encrypting file systems
like NCryptfs~\cite{wright03ncryptfs}. Although we have not implemented \Kudos\
\modules\ for these extensions, we believe that the \Kudos\ \module\ system is
flexible enough to allow straightforward implementations of these ideas.
\todo{Cite type-safe disks?}
%%  NCryptfs has been written in a
%% stackable way already, allowing it to be easily adapted for new underlying file
%% systems -- but FS2 is currently specific to ext2, since it deals directly with
%% low-level disk structures. The \Kudos\ \module\ interface should allow such an
%% extension to be written in a portable way, giving it the same benefit.
