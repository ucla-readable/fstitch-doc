\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\Kudos\ provides a new way for file system implementations to formalize write
ordering requirements, allowing such software to be divided into \modules\
which cooperate loosely to implement strong consistency guarantees, and it
explores several optimizations to the new \chdesc\ abstraction which
significantly improve the performance of the system.  It simplifies many
aspects of the design of consistency protocols like journaling and soft updates
by separating the specification and enforcement of the write ordering
requirements. Additionally, \chdescs\ can be extended outside the file system
implementation into userspace, allowing applications to specify in a limited
way what their specific consistency requirements are, providing the file system
implementation more freedom to reorder writes without violating the
application's needs. We argue that this system can be made fast enough for
general purpose use, and we demonstrate with case studies that the extension of
the new \Kudos\ abstraction into userspace can improve the efficiency of
applications with specific write ordering requirements.
