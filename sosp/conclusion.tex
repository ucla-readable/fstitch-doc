\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\Kudos\ provides a new way for file system implementations to formalize
write ordering requirements, allowing file system software to be divided
into \modules\ that cooperate loosely to implement strong consistency
guarantees. We also explored several optimizations to the \chdesc\
abstraction that significantly improve performance.  \Patches\
simplify the design of consistency protocols like
journaling and soft updates by separating the specification and enforcement
of write ordering requirements. Additionally, \chdescs\ can be extended
outside the file system implementation into userspace, allowing
applications to specify in a limited way what their specific consistency
requirements are, providing the file system implementation more freedom to
reorder writes without violating the application's needs. 
Extending the \patch\ abstraction into user space may be able to improve
the efficiency of applications with specific write ordering requirements.
