\subsection{\Noop\ \ChDescs}
\label{sec:chdescs:noop}
\Chdescs\ as so far described can be tedious and inefficient to manage when
dealing with large sets of them corresponding to file system operations. For
instance, if writing some file \texttt{\after.txt} is to depend on writing some
other file \texttt{\before.txt}, it will be inconvenient to keep arrays of all
the \chdescs\ corresponding to the two operations and inefficient to store the
potentially quadratic number of edges in the \chdesc\ graph.

To solve this problem, we introduce an additional type of \chdesc. The
prototypical \chdesc\ corresponds to some change on disk, but \Kudos\ also
supports \aemphnoop\ \chdesc\ type, which doesn't change the disk at all.
\Noop\ \chdescs\ can have \befores, like other \chdescs, but they don't need to
be written to disk (nor are they associated with a cached disk block): they are
trivially satisfied when all of their \befores\ are satisfied. Thus, they can be
used to ``stand for'' entire sets of other changes.
%
This capability is extremely useful, and is used by most operations on disk
structures so that a single \chdesc\ can be returned that depends on the whole
change. Likewise, \anoop\ \chdesc\ can be passed in as a parameter to a disk
operation to make the whole operation depend on a set of other changes. \Noop\
\chdescs\ allow dependencies between sets with only a linear number of
dependency edges in the \chdesc\ graph, and without having to pass around arrays
of \chdescs.
%
The cost is that some functions may have to traverse trees of \noop\ \chdescs\
to determine true dependencies.

Modules can also use \noop\ \chdescs\ to \emph{prevent} changes from being
written. A \emph{managed} \noop\ \chdesc\ must be explicitly satisfied; any
changes that depend on that \noop\ \chdesc\ are delayed until the owning \module\
explicitly satisfies it. This is used, for instance, by the journal \module\
(\S\ref{sec:using:journal}) to prevent a transaction's \chdescs\ from
being written before the journal commits.

\Noop\ \chdescs\ are not included in our formal model of \chdescs\ in
\S\ref{sec:chdescs:model} for simplicity; they add some additional complexity
but do not change the basic ideas.
