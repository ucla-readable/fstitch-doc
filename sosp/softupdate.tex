\subsection {Soft Updates}
\label{sec:consistency:softupdate}

Generally, a file system image is consistent if a program like \emph{fsck}
would report no errors -- that is, all the structures are in a completely
correct organization.  
%
Soft updates aims, by enforcing orderings between disk writes, to maintain
a file system in a relatively consistent state at all times, speeding reboot
by avoiding \emph{fsck}.
%
Not all invariants can be preserved, so soft updates relaxes the least
critical: a crash or sudden reboot can leak blocks or other disk
structures, but can never create more serious inconsistencies.
%
%% It is not generally possible to maintain this invariant,
%% so in the ``soft updates''~\cite{ganger00soft} system this definition is
%% relaxed slightly by allowing some structures (like inodes or disk blocks) to be
%% marked as allocated even though there are no references to them. The key
%% observation is that this will not cause any harm beyond making the structures
%% unusable until they are discovered and reclaimed, which can be done safely in
%% the background while the file system is in use.
%
%% This relaxed consistency invariant can be implemented by carefully ordering the
%% writes to the disk. A simple set of rules governing the order for writes,
%% mostly consisting of the idea that a structure should never be marked free
%% while a reference to a structure still exists on the disk, accomplishes this
%% easily. 

In the FFS implementation of soft updates, each file system operation is
represented by a structure in memory encapsulating the structural changes to the
disk image necessary to implement that operation. As a result, there exist many
specialized data structures to represent the different possible file system
operations. These structures, their relationships to one another, and their uses
for tracking and enforcing dependencies are all complex.
%
In \Kudos, \chdescs\ are used to store all changes to the disk. Rather than a
single structure that represents the whole file system operation, several
\chdescs\ are created, one for each range of bytes on the disk which must be
changed. These \chdescs\ are connected to specify the order in which the changes
must be written to disk. For instance, when a block is removed from a file, we
create (at least) two \chdescs\ in most file systems: one that clears out the
reference to that block number in the file's list of blocks, and one that marks
the block as free. By hooking up the second \chdesc\ to depend upon the first,
we can implement the soft updates semantic straightforwardly. Another example is
depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:softupdate}.

  initializing the block (Clear) and updating the free block map (Alloc).

%% The difference between soft updates and \Kudos\ is that soft updates tracks
%% these updates to the disk image at the level of file system operations, which
%% are specific to the file system in use (which, in practice, is FFS), while
%% \Kudos\ represents the changes in a file system independent way.

The \Kudos\ approach certainly takes more memory than the soft updates approach,
which limits the state required by any individual file system operation; we do
not yet address the issue of memory exhaustion.
%
However, \Kudos\ does separate dependency enforcement from dependency
specification. This makes the actual implementation easier to read, and allows
the dependency structure to be examined and modified by other \modules\ of the
system that may not have any idea what the changes are actually doing.
