\subsection{\Nrb\ \Patches}
\label{sec:patch:nrb}

The first optimization reduces space overhead by
eliminating undo data.
%
When a \patch\ $p$ is created, \Kudos\ conservatively detects whether $p$
 might require reversion:
%
that is, whether any possible future patches and dependencies could force
 the buffer cache to undo $p$ before making further progress.
%
If no future patches and dependencies could force
 $p$'s reversion, then $p$ does not need undo data.
%
The challenge is to detect this condition without predicting the future.
%
We solve this challenge by restricting dependency creation.


We implemented support for \textbf{hard patches}, which are simply patches
 that lack undo data.
%
Since a hard patch $h$ cannot be reverted, any other patch on its block
 must depend on $h$ (the other patches can't be written without $h$).
%
We enforce this requirement, for example using overlap
 dependencies, and
%
as a result, the buffer cache will write a block's hard patches (if any)
 whenever it writes the block.
%
The system aims to reduce memory usage by making most patches hard.


But which patches can be made hard?
%
Define a \emph{block-level cycle} as a dependency chain of uncommitted
 patches $p_n \PDepend \cdots \PDepend p_1$ where the ends have the same
 block $\PBlock{p_n} = \PBlock{p_1}$, and at least one patch in the middle
 has a different block $\PBlock{p_i} \neq \PBlock{p_1}$.
%
The patch $p_n$ is called the \emph{head} of the block-level cycle.
%
Now assume that a patch $p \in \PMem$ is not the head of any block-level
 cycle.
%
One can then show that the buffer cache can always write a block without
 rolling back $p$.
%
The hard case is where $\PBlock{p}$ cannot itself be written without
 rolling back $p$, which occurs when $p$ has an uncommitted dependency $q$
 on a different block.
%
However, we know that $q$'s uncommitted dependencies, if any, are all on
 blocks other than $p$'s; otherwise there would be a block-level cycle.
%
Since \Featherstitch\ disallows circular dependencies, every
 chain of dependencies starting at $q$ has finite length, and therefore
 contains an uncommitted patch $x$ all of whose dependencies have
 been committed.
%
(If $x$ has in-flight dependencies, simply wait
 for the disk controller to commit them.)
%
Since $x$ is not on $p$'s block, the buffer cache can write $x$ without
 rolling back $p$.


\Featherstitch\ may thus make a patch hard when it can prove that patch
 will never be the head of a block-level cycle.
%
This requires two tricks.
%
First, an API restriction allows us to search for \emph{existing},
 rather than future, block-level cycles:
%
\emph{A \patch's direct dependencies are all supplied at creation time}.
%
After $p$ is created, the system can add new dependencies $q \PDDepend p$,
 but will never add new dependencies $p \PDDepend q$.\footnote{The actual
 rule is somewhat more flexible: modules may add new direct dependencies if
 they guarantee that those dependencies don't produce any new block-level
 cycles.  As one example, if no \patch\ depends on some \noop\ \patch\ $e$,
 then adding a new $e \PDDepend q$ dependency can't produce a cycle.}
%
Since every \patch\ follows this rule, all possible block-level cycles with
 head $p$ are present in the dependency graph when $p$ is created.
%
\Featherstitch\ must still check for these cycles, of course, and
%
actual graph traversals proved expensive.
%
We thus implemented a conservative approximation: \patch\ $p$ is
created as \nrb\ if \emph{no} patches on other blocks depend on uncommitted
 patches on $\PBlock{p}$.
%
That is, given any dependency between uncommitted patches $y \PDepend x$,
 either $\PBlock{x}$ isn't on $p$'s block or \emph{both} $x$ and $y$ are on
 $p$'s block.
%
If this holds, then $p$ cannot head a block-level cycle no matter its
 dependencies.
%
This heuristic works well in practice and, given some bookkeeping, 
 takes $O(1)$ time to check.


\begin{comment}
\Kudos\ further ensures that the dependency structure correctly
represents dependencies on the same block through overlap
dependencies: since \nrb\ \patches\ are considered to cover the entire
block, every succeeding \patch\ will overlap at least one \nrb\ \patch,
and \Kudos\ will automatically add a dependency.
%
(Some cases are handled by other optimizations.)


The buffer cache's ``write block'' behavior must account for \nrb\
\patches, as it \emph{must} write any \nrb\ \patches\ that exist on a
block.
%
Let $\PHard[b]$ be the set of \nrb\ \patches\ on block $b$.
%
Then to write block $b$, the buffer cache must choose some $P \subseteq
\PMem[b]$ with
%
\[ \PDepset{P} \subseteq P \cup \PDisk \text{ and } \PHard[b] \cap \PMem
\subseteq P. \]
%
If no such $P$ exists, then the cache must write a different block.
\end{comment}


Applying \nrb\ \patch\ rules to our example makes 14 of the 23 \patches\ \nrb\
(Figure~\ref{fig:opt}b),
%
reducing the undo data required by slightly more than half.


\begin{comment}
%
To avoid this overhead, \Kudos\ identifies \patches\ that will never
need to be reverted and omits their undo data. We call these \emph{\nrb}
\patches. (The opposite naturally being a \emph{\rb} \patch, when
necessary to differentiate them.)
%
Since a \nrb\ \patch\ cannot be reverted, a write of any \patches\
on block $\PB$ must include all \nrb\ \patches\ on $\PB$. To accordingly
update our formal model we define a new set of \patches, \PHard, which
contains all \nrb\ \patches. We write \PHard[\PB] to restrict the set
to block $\PB$\todo{Introduce \PSoft\ and \PSoft[\PB].}:

\begin{tabbing}
\textbf{Write block.} \\
\quad Pick some block $b$ with $\PMem[b] \neq \emptyset$. \\
\quad Pick some $P \subseteq \PMem[b]$ with $\PDepset{P} \subseteq P \cup
\PDisk$ and $\PHard[\PB] \subseteq P$. \\
\quad Move each $p \in P$ to $\PInf$ (in-flight). \\
\quad For each $p \in \PMem[\PB]-P$, set $\PDDepset{p} \gets \PDDepset{p}
\cup P$.
\end{tabbing}

\paragraph{}
To avoid (expensive) dependency traversals to determine whether a new
\patch\ will need to be reverted,
%
\Kudos\ conservatively identifies \nrb\ \patches\ using only local
dependency information.
%
\Kudos\ detects that a new \patch\ on block $\PB$ may need to be reverted if:
\todo{Which form is easier to read? Can we write \(\PMem - \PMem[\PB] - \PEmpty\) more concisely?}
%
\todo{Actually, our implementation also uses in flight \patches. Can we make
it not?}
%
\[ \PRDepset{\PMem[b]} \cap (\PMem - \PMem[b] - \PEmpty) \ne \emptyset \]
\[ \exists \inset{p}{\PMem[b]}\!:\
   \exists c\!:\ \exists \inset{q}{\PMem[c]}\!:\
   \indirdepends{q}{p} \]
%
This is both a safe and useful indicator because
%
the presence of an external \after\ is a necessary condition for a new
\patch's \before\ to induce a block-level cycle
%
and many blocks have no \patches\ with external \afters\ (e.g. most
file data blocks).

While this algorithm detects whether a \patch\ may need to be reverted,
\Kudos\ must also be sure that no future dependency manipulation
will cause the \patch\ to require being reverted.
%
We introduce Invariant~\ref{cdinvar:add-before} to support such reasoning:
%
\cdinvar{add-before}{All block-level cycles induced through
\patch\ \p{p}'s \befores\ exist when \p{p} is
created\todo{Change this phrasing? ``Once created, a \patch\ will not
gain any \befores\ that induce block-level cycles.''}.}
%
\noindent \Kudos\ ensures this invariant by restricting \before\
additions to \patch\ creation, \noop\ \patches\ with no \afters, or
when the invariant is statically proven to hold for the affected
\patches.
