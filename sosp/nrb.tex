\subsection{\Nrb\ \ChDescs}
\label{sec:chdescs:nrb}
To enable \chdesc\ rollback, each \chdesc\ contains a copy of the previous block
data.\footnote{Actually, \Kudos\ supports a specialized type of \chdesc\ for
efficiently flipping individual bits using an inline exclusive-or mask instead
of a copy of the previous data, but most \chdescs\ are not of this type.}
%
While these copies are needed to roll back \chdescs, many \chdescs\ are never
actually rolled back (e.g. file data blocks) and previous data copies nearly
double the memory usage of \chdescs\ and cached blocks.
%
\Kudos\ addresses this issue by identifying those \chdescs\ which will never
need to be rolled back, and omitting the previous data copies for them. We call
these \emph{\nrb} \chdescs. (The opposite naturally being a \emph{\rb} \chdesc,
when necessary to differentiate them.) Since \nrb\ \chdescs\ cannot be rolled
back, whenever a block containing \nrb\ \chdescs\ is written, they must all be
written with the block. This means that our formal model needs some revision.
First we define a new set of \chdescs, \ChNrb, which contains all \nrb\
\chdescs. We will write \ChNrbB{B} to restrict the set to a single block. Now we
can add an additional requirement to the second event from the model, the event
corresponding to writing blocks to the disk controller, to enforce the condition
that all \nrb\ \chdescs\ are written when the block is written:

\paragraph{Write block to disk controller}
For some block $B$: \\
Let $P \subseteq$ \ChMemB{B} such that \BeforeS{P} $\subseteq$ \ChDisk\ $\cup\ P$,
and such that \ChNrbB{B} $\subseteq\ P$ \\
Let \p{p}.state $:=$ \stateinf\ for all \p{p} $\in$ $P$

\paragraph{} To identify potential \nrb\ \chdescs, \Kudos\ uses a conservative
algorithm based on a \chdesc\ graph invariant. Merely detecting that the current
\chdesc\ graph can be written without rolling back a particular \chdesc\ is not
sufficient, as the graph may change in the future. Thus we need an invariant
which will guarantee that future changes to the graph will not require \nrb\
\chdescs\ to be rolled back, where \nrb\ \chdescs\ are selected based on some
property of the current graph.

\cdinvar{add-before}{All block-level cycles induced through
\chdesc\ $C$'s \befores\ exist when $C$ is
created\todo{Change this phrasing? ``Once created, a \chdesc\ will not
gain any \befores\ that induce block-level cycles.''}.}
%
\Kudos\ ensures this invariant by restricting \before\ additions to
\chdesc\ creation, \noop\ \chdescs\ with no \afters, or when the invariant
is statically proven to hold.

To avoid a costly dependency traversal to determine whether a new
\chdesc\ will need to be rolled back, \Kudos\ conservatively identifies
a new \chdesc\ as \nrb\ only if the block has no \chdescs\
with external (on a different block\todo{Descriptive enough? Mention
\noop\ \chdesc\ \after\ recursion?}) \afters. Each block tracks the number of
external \afters\ through incremental updates as \afters\ are added and
removed.
