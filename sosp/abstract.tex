\begin{abstract}

The reliability of a file system to correctly store and later provide
 access to data is one of its most important properties.
%
File systems today deal with many challenges that make implementing this
 reliability difficult: power losses, software failures, and even user
 intervention all pose significant threats.
%
In order to avoid time-consuming and potentially ineffective manual
 checks like \emph{fsck} when recovering from failures, file systems use
 a variety of techniques.
%
These mechanisms all rely on a critical, yet often implicitly specified,
 ``write before'' relationship among buffered changes to the data in
 stable storage.
%
Further, these relationships are implemented in system-dependent ways,
 either with rules specialized for each file system
 structure~\cite{ganger00soft} or with a journal.
%
We present a general \emph{\patch} abstraction that makes this relationship
 explicit, and represents it in a file system agnostic manner.
%
A \patch-based file system implementation expresses dependencies among
 writes to stable storage, but does not enforce specific block write orders
 that satisfy those dependencies.
%
Storage system \modules\ can examine, preserve, and modify the dependency
 structure.
%
These generalized file system dependencies are naturally exportable to
 user level, allowing applications to specify their own consistency
 protocols for the storage system to follow.

We present the \patch\ abstraction, describe a number of important
 optimizations for \patch-based storage systems, and present a Linux kernel
 implementation of a storage subsystem that uses \patches\ to enforce
 consistency.
%
Our ext2 prototype is competitive with Linux ext2 and ext3 and allows
 several novel configurations, such as ext2 with soft updates or correct
 dependency enforcement within a loopback file system.
%
Finally, we demonstrate three applications which we have modified to
 take advantage of our user level \patch\ interface, called \patchgroups,
 to provide strong consistency guarantees without micromanaging writes to
 the disk.


\begin{comment}

File systems ensure that their data is kept consistent through careful
 write ordering, where certain disk blocks must be committed to stable
 storage before other blocks.
%
Previous file systems have enforced write orderings in system-dependent
 ways, either with rules specialized for each file system
 structure~\cite{ganger00soft} or with a journal, which enforces a
 particular consistency protocol.
%
We present a general \emph{\patch} abstraction that can represent any
 write ordering in a file system agnostic manner.

We propose a file system implementation architecture, called \emph{\Kudos},
where structures called \emph{\patches} represent any and all changes to
stable storage.
%
%%  File systems generate \patches\ for all writes, then
%% send them to block devices for eventual commit. Explicit dependencies between
%% \patches\ let \Kudos\ \modules\ preserve necessary file system
%% invariants without understanding the file system itself. \Patches\ can
%% implement many consistency mechanisms, including soft updates and journaling.
%
\Kudos\ is decomposed into fine-grained \modules\ which generate, consume,
 forward, and manipulate \patches.
%
The uniform abstraction of \patches\ allows modules to impose and
 follow arbitrary file system consistency policies: a collection of
 loosely-coupled modules cooperates to implement strong and possibly
 complex guarantees, even though each individual module does a relatively
 small part of the work.
%
%% A particular innovation of the
%% \module\ design is the separation of the low-level specification of on-disk
%% layout from higher-level file system-independent code, which operates on
%% abstract disk structures. 
%
For example, by observing and modifying \patch\ constraints, our
 journaling \module\ can automatically add journaling to any file system.
%
Additionally, a new system call interface gives applications some direct
 control over \patches. We have used this interface to
improve the UW IMAP server, removing inefficient and unnecessary calls to
\texttt{fsync()} while preserving the integrity of mail messages.
%
We have implemented \Kudos\ as a Linux kernel module. Our current
implementation is competitive with FreeBSD soft updates for number of
blocks written, and allows several novel configurations like ext2 with
soft updates or correct UFS soft updates over a loopback device.
