\subsection {Interfaces}
\label{sec:modules:interfaces}

A complete \Kudos\ configuration is composed of many \modules. New \modules\ are
simple to write, and by changing the \module\ arrangement, a broad range of
behaviors can be implemented. It's also easy to tell what behavior a given
arrangement will give just by looking at the connections between the \modules.

\Kudos\ has three major types of \modules.
%
Closest to the disk are block device (BD) \modules, which have a fairly
conventional block device interface with interfaces such as ``read block'' and
``flush''. 
%
Closest to the system call interface are \emph{common file system} (CFS)
\modules, which have an interface similar to VFS~\cite{kleiman86vnodes}. 
%
In traditional systems, a CFS-like \module\ would be connected directly to a
BD-like \module\ in order to set up a file system for mounting. In \Kudos,
however, there is an intermediate interface which interposes between block
devices and the high-level CFS interface.
%
This \emph{low-level file system} (\LFS) interface helps divide file system
implementations into common (reusable) code and file system specific code. A
\Kudos\ file system designer combines modules with all three interfaces in many
ways -- a departure from stackable file systems, which act only at the VFS/CFS
layer. \Kudos\ \modules\ are implemented in C using structures of function
pointers to achieve object oriented behavior, very much like the rest of the
Linux kernel.

The \LFS\ interface has functions to allocate blocks, add blocks to files,
allocate file names, and other file system micro-ops. A \module\ implementing
the \LFS\ interface should define how bits are laid out on the disk, but doesn't
have to know how to combine the micro-ops into larger, more familiar file system
operations. A generic CFS-to-\LFS\ \module\ decomposes the larger file write,
read, append, and other standard operations into \LFS\ micro-ops. This module,
called UHFS, is described in the next section.

Each \chdesc\ on a cached block may or may not be visible to a given \module.
For example, \modules\ that respond to user requests generally view the most
current state of every block -- the block with all \chdescs\ applied. However, a
write-back cache may choose to write some \chdescs\ on a block while reverting
others, since those others currently have unsatisfied \befores. In this case,
\modules\ below the write-back cache (i.e. closer to the disk) should view the
unsatisfied \chdescs\ in the reverted state. \Kudos\ provides a block
revisioning library function that automatically rolls back those \chdescs\ that
should not be visible at a particular \module, and then rolls them forward again
after that \module\ is done with the block.
