Every change to stable storage in a \Kudos\ system is represented by a
\emph{patch}.
%
This section describes the basic patch abstraction using a semi-formal
notation that will be useful for analyzing our optimizations later.
%
Although the patch idea would apply to any stable medium, or to network
file systems, we use terms like ``disk'' and ``disk controller'' throughout
to simplify our terminology.
%
Our patch notation is summarized in Figure~\ref{f:patchnot}.

Each patch $p$ encapsulates four important pieces of state: its
 \emph{block}, its \emph{state}, a set of \emph{direct dependencies}, and
 some \emph{rollback data}.

Patch $p$'s \textbf{block}, written $\PBlock{p}$, is the unit of disk data
 to which $p$ applies.  The disk controller is assumed to write blocks as a
 unit (although not necessarily atomically; see below).  A file system
 change that affects $n$ blocks must be represented using at least $n$
 patches, since a patch by definition can touch only one block.

\begin{figure}
\begin{small}
\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
$\PBlock{p} = b$ & $p$'s block \\
$\PState{p}$ & $p$'s state, $\in \{\PMemst, \PInfst, \PDiskst\}$ \\
~~~~$\PMem$ & all in-memory patches: $\{p \mid \PState{p} = \PMemst\}$ \\
~~~~$\PMem[b]$ & $\{p \mid \PState{p} = \PMemst \text{ and } \PBlock{p} = b
 \}$ \\
~~~~$\PInf, \PDisk$ & similarly for in-flight and on-disk patches \\
$\PDDepset{p}$ & $p$'s direct dependencies \\
~~~~$p \PDDepend q$ & $p$ directly depends on $q$: $q \in \PDDepset{p}$ \\
~~~~$p \PDepend q$ & $p$ depends on $q$: either $p \PDDepend q$ or there exists \\
       & a patch $x$ so that $p \PDepend x \PDDepend q$ \\
~~~~$\PDepset{p}$ & $p$'s dependencies: $\{ q \mid p \PDepend q \}$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{small}

Each patch is in one of three \textbf{states}: \emph{in memory}; \emph{in
 flight} to the disk controller, but not yet committed to disk; and
 \emph{on disk}.  The intermediate in-flight state is necessary because
 operating system software loses control of a patch upon writing its block
 to disk.  $p$'s state is written $\PState{p} \in \{\PMemst, \PInfst,
 \PDiskst\}$.  The operating system changes a patch's state from
 \PMemst\ to \PInfst\ by writing its block to the disk controller.  Some
 time later---after possible OS-level disk scheduling, transit over the
 system bus, and a period in the disk's cache---the disk writes the block
 to stable storage and reports success.  When the processor receives this
 notification, it changes the patch's state to \PDiskst.
%
The sets \PMem, \PInf, and \PDisk\ are defined to contain all patches with
 the given state, and the sets $\PMem[b]$, $\PInf[b]$, and $\PDisk[b]$ are
 defined to contain all patches with the given state \emph{on the given
 block} $b$.

Patch $p$'s \textbf{direct dependencies}, written $\PDDepset{p}$, is a set of
 other patches on which $p$ ``depends''.
%
That is, every patch in $\PDDepset{p}$ should be committed to disk either
 before, or at the same time as, $p$ itself.
%
Dependencies are set by the file system based on whatever consistency
 semantics it wants to ensure.
%
For example, a file system with asynchronous writes (and no durability
 guarantees) might write all patches with $\PDDepset{p} = \emptyset$;
%
a file system implementing soft updates would arrange the dependencies
 accordingly;
%
and a file system implementing journaling would write a different set of
 dependencies, where the journal commit record would depend on the journal
 data and the writes to the main body of the file system would in turn
 depend on the commit record.
%
Thus, an upper file system layer defines an initial set of
 dependencies.
%
The rest of \Kudos\ generally preserves this initial set, but can modify
 them as necessary to change or fix dependency semantics.
%
Finally, the buffer cache obeys the constraints they define.


We say $p$ \emph{directly depends on} $q$, and write $p \PDDepend q$, when
 $q \in \PDDepset{p}$.
%
We say $p$ \emph{depends on} $q$, and write $p \PDepend q$, when there
 exists a dependency chain from $p$ to $q$: that is, either $p \PDDepend q$
 or, for some patch $x$, $p \PDepend x \PDDepend q$.
%
Patch $p$'s set of \emph{dependencies} is written $\PDepset{p} = \{ q \mid
 p \PDepend q \}$; this is of course a superset of its direct dependencies.



\textbf{Rollback data.}
%
Soft updates-like consistency orderings may require that the buffer cache
\emph{not} write one or more \patches\ on some block.
%
In particular, a series of file system operations may create dependencies
that enforce a circular order among blocks, even though the dependencies
themselves do not form a cycle~\cite{ganger00soft}.
%
This is problematic since blocks with circular dependencies can never be
written: no block can be written first since each block depends on another.
%
For this reason, each \patch\ carries \emph{rollback} information that gives
the previous version of the data altered by the \patch.
%
If a \patch\ $p$ is not written with its containing block, the system rolls
back the \patch, which swaps the new data and the previous version.
%
Once the block is written, the system will roll the \patch\ forward and, when
allowed, write the block again, this time including the \patch.
%
Rollback information adds greatly to memory and CPU utilization, but it can
often be optimized away, as we show below.




\paragraph{Generalizations}

Levels of the file system





The disk's behavior is encapsulated in the following action,
which might happen at any time:

\begin{tabbing}
\quad \textbf{Commit block.} \\
\qquad Pick some block $b$. \\
\qquad For each $p \in \PInf[b]$, set $\PState{p} \gets \PDiskst$.
\end{tabbing}


We note that soft updates-like consistency protocols demand more from disks
than many journal protocols.
%
Neither type of protocol assumes that data is committed until the disk
reports success.
%
However, soft updates inherently assumes that blocks are written
\emph{atomically}, except in the case of catastrophic media error.
%
In particular, if the disk fails while a block $b$ is in flight, then $b$'s
value on recovery must equal either the old value or the new value.
%
Most journal designs also handle the case where in-flight blocks might be
corrupted on recovery---for instance, perhaps because the memory holding
the new value of the block lost its coherence before the disk stopped
writing~\cite{tso}.
%
However, some disks actually do provide an atomicity guarantee, for
instance by using non-volatile memory to store blocks before they make it
onto disk~\cite{???}.
%
The \Kudos\ core makes no assumptions about block atomicity, instead relying
on software above it to implement a consistency protocol that makes sense
for the given disk.




The \textbf{disk safety property} is simply written
%
\[ \PDepset{\PDisk} \subseteq \PDisk. \]
%
That is, the dependencies of all \patches\ on disk are always also on disk,
and
%
no matter when the system crashes, the disk is consistent in terms of
dependencies.
%
The file system's job is to set up dependencies so that the disk safety
property implies file system correctness.
%
(This might involve compensating for the possibility that in-flight blocks
can be corrupted on recovery.)


The storage system cannot control when the disk controller commits blocks;
instead, it controls when blocks are released to the controller.
%
It therefore maintains the disk safety property by enforcing, instead, the
\textbf{in-flight safety property}: For any block $b$ with $\PInf[b] \neq
\emptyset$,
%
\[ \PDepset{\PInf[b]} \subseteq \PInf[b] \cup \PDisk . \]
%
This, combined with the disk's ``commit block'' behavior above, implies the
disk safety property.
%
The buffer cache's job is to write \patches\ in an order that obeys the
in-flight safety property.
\todo{mention liveness property?}


The buffer cache's required behavior is then encapsulated in the following
action:

\begin{tabbing}
\textbf{Write block.} \\
\quad Pick some block $b$ with $\PMem[b] \neq \emptyset$. \\
\quad Pick some $P \subseteq \PMem[b]$ with $\PDepset{P} \subseteq P \cup
\PDisk$. \\
\quad For each $p \in P$, set $\PState{p} \gets \PInfst$. \\
\quad For each $p \in \PMem[b]-P$, set $\PDDepset{p} \gets \PDDepset{p}
\cup P$.
\end{tabbing}

\noindent
%
The last step forces any rolled-back \patches\ to wait in memory at least
until the current version of the block is written.  (Our implementation
achieves this property without using dependencies.)
%
It is easy to show that this action preserves the in-flight safety property
and, thus, the disk safety property.

\subsection{Challenges}
\label{sec:patch:challenges}

A naive implementation of this model scales extremely poorly,
particularly with cache size.
%
Challenges in a \patch-based file system implementation include:

\textbf{Buffer cache graph traversal.}
%
In order to evict and write a block, the buffer cache must choose a block
$b$,
%
and then find a set of \patches\ $P_b \subseteq \PMem[b]$ whose dependencies
satisfy a graph property, namely that $\PDepset{P_b} \subseteq P_b \cup
\PDisk$.
%
It usually makes sense to define $P_b$ maximally---that is, as the
\emph{largest} corresponding set of \patches.
%
In the ideal (and common) case $P_b = \PMem[b]$, which lets the cache reuse
$b$'s memory once $P_b$ is committed to disk.  However, in some cases there
may be no block for which $P_b = \PMem[b]$.
%
It would also be nice if the blocks chosen for writing also maximized the
disk's commit rate, by minimizing seeks and so forth.

A naive implementation might calculate, for each in-memory block $b$, the
largest set of \patches\ $P_b \subseteq \PMem[b]$ with $\PDepset{P_b}
\subseteq P_b \cup \PDisk$, then evict some block close to previously
written blocks and with few rolled-back \patches\ (where $\PMem[b] - P_b$
is small).
%
This, however, would be extraordinarily expensive.
%
Finding $P_b$ requires traversing a dependency graph which might contain
thousands and thousands of nodes.
%
Doing so for each block, once per eviction, would take huge amounts of CPU
time.


\textbf{Rollback memory usage.}
%
Only a small fraction of \patches\ will ever need to be rolled back.
%
For example, most data writes never need to be rolled back in any file
system.
%
If a \patch\ won't be rolled back under any circumstances, the memory and
CPU time spent to preserve the old version is wasted.


\textbf{\Patch\ memory usage.}
%
Patches themselves take up memory and require time to allocate, free, and
traverse.
%
If two \patches\ have redundant dependencies, it would be faster to combine
them.


%% \textbf{Dependency memory usage.}
%% %
%% The $\PDDepset{}$ sets are stored as doubly linked lists; each individual
%% dependency takes up memory.
%% %
%% Important and common dependency relations require many dependencies to
%% express; for example, if \patches\ $p_1,\dots,p_n$ depend, as a group, on
%% \patches\ $q_1,\dots,q_n$, expressing this constraint would require $n^2$
%% total dependencies.


The next section tackles all of these challenges.
