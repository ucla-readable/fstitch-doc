Every change to stable storage in a \Kudos\ system is represented by a
\emph{patch}.
%
This section describes the basic patch abstraction using a semi-formal
notation that will be useful for analyzing our optimizations later.
%
Although the patch idea would apply to any stable medium, or to network
file systems, we use terms like ``disk'' and ``disk controller'' throughout
to simplify our terminology.
%
Our patch notation is summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:patchnot}.

Each patch $p$ encapsulates four important pieces of information: its
 \emph{block}, its \emph{state}, a set of \emph{direct dependencies}, and
 some \emph{rollback data}.

Patch $p$'s \textbf{block}, written $\PBlock{p}$, is the unit of disk data
 to which $p$ applies.  The disk controller is assumed to write blocks as a
 unit (although not necessarily atomically; see below).  A file system
 change that affects $n$ blocks must be represented using at least $n$
 patches, since a patch by definition can touch only one block.

\begin{figure}
\begin{small}
\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
$\PBlock{p} = b$ & $p$'s block \\
$\PState{p}$ & $p$'s state, $\in \{\PMemst, \PInfst, \PDiskst\}$ \\
~~~~$\PMem$ & all in-memory patches: $\{p \mid \PState{p} = \PMemst\}$ \\
~~~~$\PMem[b]$ & $\{p \mid \PState{p} = \PMemst \text{ and } \PBlock{p} = b
 \}$ \\
~~~~$\PInf, \PDisk$ & similarly for in-flight and on-disk patches \\
$\PDDepset{p}$ & $p$'s direct dependencies \\
~~~~$p \PDDepend q$ & $p$ directly depends on $q$: $q \in \PDDepset{p}$ \\
~~~~$p \PDepend q$ & $p$ depends on $q$: either $p \PDDepend q$ or there exists \\
       & a patch $x$ so that $p \PDepend x \PDDepend q$ \\
~~~~$\PDepset{p}$ & $p$'s dependencies: $\{ q \mid p \PDepend q \}$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{small}

Each patch is in one of three \textbf{states}: \emph{in memory}; \emph{in
 flight} to the disk controller, but not yet committed to disk; and
 \emph{on disk}.  The intermediate in-flight state is necessary because
 operating system software loses control of a patch upon writing its block
 to disk.  $p$'s state is written $\PState{p} \in \{\PMemst, \PInfst,
 \PDiskst\}$.  The operating system changes a patch's state from
 \PMemst\ to \PInfst\ by writing its block to the disk controller.  Some
 time later---after possible OS-level disk scheduling, transit over the
 system bus, and a period in the disk's cache---the disk writes the block
 to stable storage and reports success.  When the processor receives this
 notification, it changes the patch's state to \PDiskst.
%
The sets \PMem, \PInf, and \PDisk\ are defined to contain all patches with
 the given state, and the sets $\PMem[b]$, $\PInf[b]$, and $\PDisk[b]$ are
 defined to contain all patches with the given state \emph{on the given
 block} $b$.

Patch $p$'s \textbf{direct dependencies}, written $\PDDepset{p}$, is a set of
 other patches on which $p$ ``depends''.
%
That is, every patch in $\PDDepset{p}$ should be committed to disk either
 before, or at the same time as, $p$ itself.
%
Dependencies are set by the file system based on whatever consistency
 semantics it wants to ensure.
%
For example, a file system with asynchronous writes (and no durability
 guarantees) might write all patches with $\PDDepset{p} = \emptyset$;
%
a file system implementing soft updates would arrange the dependencies
 accordingly;
%
and a file system implementing journaling would write a different set of
 dependencies, where the journal commit record would depend on the journal
 data and the writes to the main body of the file system would in turn
 depend on the commit record.
%
Thus, an upper file system layer defines an initial set of
 dependencies.
%
The rest of \Kudos\ generally preserves this initial set, but can modify
 them as necessary to change or fix dependency semantics.
%
Finally, the buffer cache obeys the constraints thus defined.


We say $p$ \emph{directly depends on} $q$, and write $p \PDDepend q$, when
 $q \in \PDDepset{p}$.
%
We say $p$ \emph{depends on} $q$, and write $p \PDepend q$, when there
 exists a dependency chain from $p$ to $q$: that is, either $p \PDDepend q$
 or, for some patch $x$, $p \PDepend x \PDDepend q$.
%
Patch $p$'s set of \emph{dependencies} is written $\PDepset{p} = \{ q \mid
 p \PDepend q \}$; this is of course a superset of its direct dependencies.
%
Given a \emph{set} of patches $P$, we write $\PDepset{P}$ to mean the set's
 combined dependencies $\bigcup_{p\in P} \PDepset{p}$.



\textbf{Rollback data.}
%
Soft updates-like consistency orderings may require that the buffer cache
\emph{not} write one or more \patches\ on some block.
%
In particular, a series of file system operations may create dependencies
that enforce a circular order among blocks, even though the dependencies
themselves do not form a cycle~\cite{ganger00soft}.
%
This is problematic since blocks with circular dependencies can never be
written: no block can be written first since each block depends on another.
%
For this reason, each \patch\ carries \emph{rollback} information that gives
the previous version of the data altered by the \patch.
%
If a \patch\ $p$ is not written with its containing block, the system rolls
back the \patch, which swaps the new data and the previous version.
%
Once the block is written, the system will roll the \patch\ forward and, when
allowed, write the block again, this time including the \patch.
%
Rollback information adds greatly to memory and CPU utilization, but it can
often be optimized away, as we show below.


\subsection{Obeying dependencies}
\label{sec:patch:dependencies}

\Kudos\ must ensure the \textbf{disk safety property}, which states that
 the dependencies of all patches on disk are also on disk:
%
\[ \PDepset{\PDisk} \subseteq \PDisk. \]
%
Thus, no matter when the system crashes, the disk is consistent in terms of
dependencies.
%
The file system's job is to set up dependencies so that the disk safety
property implies file system correctness.

However, \Kudos\ can only control when patches are handed to the disk
 controller, not when they are written to disk.
%
Disk controller behavior is encapsulated in the following atomic action:

\begin{tabbing}
\textit{Commit block:} \\
\quad Pick some block $b$. \\
\quad For each $p \in \PInf[b]$, set $\PState{p} \gets \PDiskst$.
\end{tabbing}

\noindent
%
\Kudos\ must thus enforce the following \textbf{in-flight
 safety property}: For any block $b$,
%
\[ \PDepset{\PInf[b]} \subseteq \PInf[b] \cup \PDisk . \]
%
Since in-flight blocks are mutually independent (for any $b' \neq b$,
 $\PDepset{\PInf[b]} \cap \PDepset{\PInf[b']} \subseteq \PDisk$), the disk
 controller can safely write them in any order and still preserve the disk
 safety property.


The buffer cache must thus behave according to the following atomic action:

\begin{tabbing}
\textit{Write block:} \\
\quad Pick some block $b$ with $\PMem[b] \neq \emptyset$. \\
\quad Pick some $P \subseteq \PMem[b]$ with $\PDepset{P} \subseteq P \cup
\PDisk$. \\
\quad For each $p \in P$, set $\PState{p} \gets \PInfst$. \\
\quad For each $p \in \PMem[b]-P$, set $\PDDepset{p} \gets \PDDepset{p}
\cup P$.
\end{tabbing}

\noindent
%
Since the disk controller can write in-flight blocks in any order, at most
one version of a block can be in flight at any time.
%
Thus, the last step above forces any rolled-back \patches\ to wait in
memory at least until the in-flight version of the block is written.
%
Likewise, any patch created on a block with in-flight patches must depend
on those patches.
%
(Our implementation achieves this property without using dependencies.)
%
The buffer cache is also expected to write all blocks eventually, a
 liveness property.


This model does not completely define the disk's behavior on system crash,
 in particular with respect to in-flight blocks.
%
Soft updates inherently assumes that blocks are written
\emph{atomically}, except in the case of catastrophic media error:
%
if the disk fails while a block $b$ is in flight, then $b$'s
value on recovery must equal either the old value or the new value.
%
Most journal designs do not rely on this assumption, and can recover
 properly even if in-flight blocks are corrupted on recovery---for instance,
 because the memory holding the new value of the block lost its coherence
 before the disk stopped writing~\cite{tso}.
%
However, some disks actually do provide an atomicity guarantee, for
 instance by using non-volatile memory to store blocks before they make it
 onto disk~\cite{???}.
%
The \Kudos\ core makes no assumptions about block atomicity, instead relying
 on software above it to implement a consistency protocol that makes sense
 for the given disk.


The buffer cache can't handle cross-block dependency cycles since it must
write data in units of blocks.
%
Thus, if $p \PDepend q \PDepend p$, then $p$ and $q$ must be on the same
block; otherwise, neither $p$ nor $q$ could ever get written.
%
Whenever upper layers might generate cross-block dependency cycles,
intervening layers must break those cycles somehow before they reach the
cache.
%
For instance, a journal layer might detect dependency cycles and put the
corresponding patches into a single transaction, but the
\emph{implementation} of that transaction could not contain cross-block
cycles.
%
In practice, the \Kudos\ implementation currently disallows any dependency
cycles, including cycles within a single block; this simplifies many graph
traversals.

\subsection{Discussion}

- Levels of the file system (dependencies at one level can apply to
  different blocks, etc.)



\section{Patch Optimizations}
\label{sec:patch:optimizations}

A naive implementation of this model has all the properties we want except
good performance.
%
File system modules can define their own consistency protocols; other
modules can modify them: for instance, the journaling module we describe
below automatically changes soft updates orderings into journal
transactions.
%
Applications can affect consistency orderings, and it is all relatively
easy thanks to the patch abstraction.
%
Unfortunately, that abstraction is extremely expensive.


Consider an unoptimized version of \Kudos\ running an ext2 file system with
soft updates-like dependencies.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:opt}a shows the patches generated when an application appends
16384 bytes of data to an existing empty file.
%
This requires allocating four new 4096-byte blocks, writing data to them,
attaching them to the file's inode, changing the inode's file size and
modification time, and updating the ``group descriptor'' and superblock to
account for the allocated blocks.
%
The operation is broken into four one-block appends, each of which updates
the inode; note, for example, how overlap dependencies force each
modification of the inode's size to depend on the previous one.
%
Eight blocks are written during the operation.
%
\Kudos, however, represents the operation with 23 patches and roughly 33000
(!) bytes of rollback data.
%
The patches slow down the buffer cache system by making graph traversals
more expensive.
%
The 4096 bytes of rollback data per patch stored for ``zero data'' and
``write data'' patches, which initialize and write data blocks, is
particularly painful since in this file system, data blocks \emph{never}
need to be rolled back!


This section shows how the actual \Kudos\ system uses generic patch
properties and dependency analysis to reduce the 23 patches and 33000 bytes
of rollback data in Figure~\ref{fig:opt}a to the 8 patches and 0 bytes of
rollback data in Figure~\ref{fig:opt}d.
%
These optimizations apply transparently to any \Kudos\ file system.


\begin{comment}

Challenges in a \patch-based file system implementation include:

\textbf{Buffer cache graph traversal.}
%
In order to evict and write a block, the buffer cache must choose a block
$b$,
%
and then find a set of \patches\ $P_b \subseteq \PMem[b]$ whose dependencies
satisfy a graph property, namely that $\PDepset{P_b} \subseteq P_b \cup
\PDisk$.
%
It usually makes sense to define $P_b$ maximally---that is, as the
\emph{largest} corresponding set of \patches.
%
In the ideal (and common) case $P_b = \PMem[b]$, which lets the cache reuse
$b$'s memory once $P_b$ is committed to disk.  However, in some cases there
may be no block for which $P_b = \PMem[b]$.
%
It would also be nice if the blocks chosen for writing also maximized the
disk's commit rate, by minimizing seeks and so forth.

A naive implementation might calculate, for each in-memory block $b$, the
largest set of \patches\ $P_b \subseteq \PMem[b]$ with $\PDepset{P_b}
\subseteq P_b \cup \PDisk$, then evict some block close to previously
written blocks and with few rolled-back \patches\ (where $\PMem[b] - P_b$
is small).
%
This, however, would be extraordinarily expensive.
%
Finding $P_b$ requires traversing a dependency graph which might contain
thousands and thousands of nodes.
%
Doing so for each block, once per eviction, would take huge amounts of CPU
time.


\textbf{Rollback memory usage.}
%
Only a small fraction of \patches\ will ever need to be rolled back.
%
For example, most data writes never need to be rolled back in any file
system.
%
If a \patch\ won't be rolled back under any circumstances, the memory and
CPU time spent to preserve the old version is wasted.


\textbf{\Patch\ memory usage.}
%
Patches themselves take up memory and require time to allocate, free, and
traverse.
%
If two \patches\ have redundant dependencies, it would be faster to combine
them.


%% \textbf{Dependency memory usage.}
%% %
%% The $\PDDepset{}$ sets are stored as doubly linked lists; each individual
%% dependency takes up memory.
%% %
%% Important and common dependency relations require many dependencies to
%% express; for example, if \patches\ $p_1,\dots,p_n$ depend, as a group, on
%% \patches\ $q_1,\dots,q_n$, expressing this constraint would require $n^2$
%% total dependencies.


The next section tackles all of these challenges.
