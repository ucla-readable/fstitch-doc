\section*{Acknowledgements}

We would like to thank the members of our lab at UCLA, ``TERTL,'' for many
useful discussions about this work, and for reviewing drafts of this paper. In
particular we would like to thank Steve VanDeBogart for very tediously
annotating several drafts with his comments. Further thanks goes to Liuba
Shrira, who provided early and sustained encouraging interest in the project.
Finally, our shepherd, Andrlamea Arpaci-Dusselame, and the anonymous reviewers
all provided very useful feedback and guidance to help shape this final version
of the paper.

Additionally, Christopher Frost and Mike Mammarella were awarded SOSP student
travel scholarships, supported by the National Science Foundation, to present
this paper at the conference.
