\subsection{\ChDesc\ Merging}
\label{sec:patch:merge}

File operations such as block allocations, inode updates, and directory updates
create a large number of small, distinct \chdescs. Keeping track of many small
\chdescs\ and their dependencies requires significant amounts of memory.
%
\Kudos\ uses \emph{merges} to drastically reduces the number of \chdescs, and
thus \chdesc\ memory usage, by conservatively identifying when a new and an
existing \chdesc\ pair can be written to disk together. Rather than creating
a new \chdesc, Kudos updates the disk change and dependencies to merge the
changes into the existing \chdesc.
%
In this section we present three \chdesc\ merge algorithms. All three
use Invariant~\ref{cdinvar:add-before} to reason about future graph
changes and use fast, conservative checks during \chdesc\ creation; they
differ in their applicable conditions.

\subsubsection{\Nrb\ \ChDesc\ Merging}
\label{sec:chdescs:merge:nrb}

Recall from \S\ref{sec:chdescs:nrb} that a write of any \chdescs\ on block
$b$ must include all \nrb\ \chdescs\ on $b$.
%
This additional requirement is in fact an exquisite optimization
opportunity; it implies that all \nrb\ \chdescs\ on a given block can
be merged.
%
Further, merging can remove the need for the \nrb\ \chdesc\ implicit
dependency rules by ensuring that
%
there is at most one \nrb\ \chdesc\ per block (\nrb-\nrb\ merging)
%
and that all \rb\ \chdescs\ on a given block depend on the \nrb\ \chdesc\
(\nrb-\rb\ merging).
%
We describe these two \chdesc\ merging algorithms and how they
preserve dependency semantics in this section.

\paragraph{\Nrb-\Nrb\ \ChDesc\ Merging}
\label{sec:chdescs:merge:nrb:hard-hard}

\emph{\Nrb-\nrb\ \chdesc\ merging} merges a new \nrb\ \chdesc\ \p{q}
into an existing \nrb\ \chdesc\ \p{p} instead of creating \p{q}.
%
Any two \nrb\ \chdescs\ on the same block may be (and are) merged.
%
Merging all \nrb\ \chdescs\ ensures:
%
\cdinvar{one-nrb}{\(\forall\! b\!: |\PHard[b]| \leq 1\)}
%
\noindent
%
Invariant~\ref{cdinvar:one-nrb} simplifies \nrb\ \chdesc\ handling by
%
removing the implicit dependencies that ensure all \nrb\ \chdescs\
are written together
%
and by removing the need to scan for an existing \nrb\ \chdesc\ when
\nrb-\nrb\ \chdesc\ merging.
%
% Although merging two \chdescs\ will not induce block-level dependency
% cycles, without sufficient care merging could induce \chdesc-level
% dependency cycles.  A trivial example is merging \p{q} into \p{p} when
% \p{q} has an explicit dependency on \p{p}; the combined \p{(p+q)}
% should not and need not depend on itself.
%
To preserve dependency semantics, the merged \p{(p+q)} must depend on
the union of \p{p} and \p{q}'s transitive \befores. Additionally, while the
\chdescs\ can be merged without forming a \chdesc-level dependency cycle,
the merge must ensure that it does not introduce a needless cycle, e.g.
through \anoop\ \chdesc\ \p{e} in \depends{q}{\depends{e}{p}}
\todo{Is cycle avoidance worth mentioning? Is this a good way to mention it?}.

From Invariant~\ref{cdinvar:add-before} and the \nrb\ \chdesc\
creation condition (no external \afters), the only possible
dependencies involving \p{p} and \p{q} are those shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:nrb-merge}\todo{Should we give these deductions or a
  flavor?}.
%
Notice, for example, that any \p{r} such that
\indirdepends{q}{\indirdepends{r}{p}} is \anoop\ \chdesc\todo{This is
  a strong statement. Expand on its implications?}.
%
Our algorithm to transform dependencies for \nrb-\nrb\ \chdesc\ merges
(Figure~\ref{algo:merge:hard-hard}) follows from these possible
dependencies.
%
It updates \p{p}'s transitive \befores\ to ensure
\(\PDepset{q}\todo{Incorrect! Only the non-\noop{}s.} \subseteq
\PDepset{p}\)\todo{Note that Invariant~\ref{cdinvar:add-before}
  ensures that \noop\ \chdescs\ reachable from \p{q} will not gain
  data \chdesc\ \befores?}\todo{Note that it only needs to move dependencies?}.

\end{figure}

\noindent Algorithm called on \p{q} and \p{p}:\\
Input: \chdesc\ \p{a} and existing \nrb\ \chdesc\ \p{p}.\\
Returns: whether \indirdepends{a}{p} exists. \(\forall\! \p{b}\!: \indirdepends{a}{b}\) and \notindirdepends{b}{p}, creates \indirdepends{p}{b}.

\item If \p{a} equals \p{p}, return ``path to \p{p}.''
\item Call self on \p{a} and \p{p}.

\item For each \p{a} \before\ \p{b}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If \p{b} has no path to \p{p}:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Move \p{b} from a \before\ of \p{a} to a \before\ of \p{p}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\Nrb-\Rb\ \ChDesc\ Merging}
\label{sec:chdescs:merge:nrb:hard-soft}

When creating the first \nrb\ \chdesc\ on a block, \emph{\nrb-\rb\
  \chdesc\ merging} merges all existing (\rb) \chdescs\ into the new
\nrb\ \chdesc.
%
Such an arrangement can arise through a combination of \chdesc\ creates
and block writes; 
%
for example, the block may first obtain an initial (\nrb{}) \chdesc,
%
then gain external \afters\ on its \chdesc,
%
accumulate additional (\rb{}) \chdescs,
%
write the subset of its \chdescs\ with external \afters\ (leaving some
\rb\ \chdescs\ on the block),
%
and then gain a \nrb\ \chdesc.
%
In addition to reducing the number of data \chdescs, \nrb-\rb\
\chdesc\ merging removes the second implicit \nrb\ \chdesc\
dependency, that \rb\ \chdescs\ not explicitly dependent on the
block's \nrb\ \chdesc\ implicitly depend on it.
%
As in \nrb-\nrb\ \chdesc\ merging, \Kudos\ merges such \chdescs\ to
avoid the complications of their implicit dependencies.

\Nrb-\rb\ \chdesc\ merging's implementation first merges all \rb\ \chdescs\
into a \nrb\ \chdesc\ and then \nrb-\nrb\ \chdesc\ merges the new \nrb\
\chdesc\ into the now-existing \nrb\ \chdesc.
%
Our algorithm to transform the dependencies for \nrb-\rb\ \chdesc\
merges (Figure~\ref{algo:merge:hard-soft}) for block $b$
%
chooses a \chdesc\ \p{p} such that
\(\notexists \inset{q}{\PMem[b]}\!: \indirdepends{p}{q}\)
%
and updates its transitive \befores\ to ensure
\(\PDepset{\PSoft[b]} \subseteq \PDepset{p}\).
%
Because any \(\inset{q}{\PMem[b] - p}\) may have \afters, to
preserve dependencies we convert such a \p{q} into \anoop\ \chdesc\
and ensure \depends{q}{p}.

\noindent Algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
\item Choose a \(\inset{p}{\PMem[b]}\!:\
\notexists\! \inset{q}{\PMem[b]}\!:\ \indirdepends{p}{q}\).
\item For each \inset{q}{\PMem[b] - p}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Call the \nrb-\nrb\ \before\ move algorithm on \p{q} and \p{p}.
  \item Convert \p{q} into \anoop\ \chdesc.
  \end{itemize}
\item Convert \p{p} into a \nrb\ \chdesc\ (free it's previous data copy).
\end{itemize}

\todo{Note that \nrb-\rb\ merging is rare? Note why it is helpful even though
it is rare?}
\todo{Explain why this preserves dependency semantics? Show possible
dependencies? For the paper, free \chdescs\ instead of convert them
into \noop{}s? (Must modify \nrb-\nrb\ algo usage.)}

\subsubsection{Overlap \ChDesc\ Merging}
\label{sec:chdescs:merge:overlap}
\todo{Note as useful when new may need to be rolled back.}
Bitmap blocks and inode size fields accumulate many nearby and
overlapping mergeable \chdescs\ as data is appended to or truncated
from a file.
%
Many of these and similar \chdescs\ are mergeable and have
dependencies that allow simple (and fast) reasoning to identify many
of the mergeable pairs: two \chdescs\ on block $b$ that overlap no other \chdescs\ in \PMem[b]
and which have no dependency path from the new to the existing \chdesc\
will not induce a block-level cycle and so are writable together.
We know that \textit{later} changes will not cause them to induce a block-level cycle due to
invariant~\ref{cdinvar:add-before} and by not merging if the new \chdesc\
has a before and the before is marked as allowed to violate
invariant~\ref{cdinvar:add-before}.
%
While path existence testing is expensive, a conservative path test
of only a depth of two identifies most mergeable \chdescs. If the new
\chdesc\ has an explicit \before\ that is not the existing \chdesc\ and
this \before\ has a \before, then there may be a path to the existing
\chdesc.
%
To merge two such overlapping \chdescs, add the new \chdesc's explicit
before to the existing \chdesc\ (if any and if not the existing \chdesc).


%%

At the end of \chdesc\ optimizations, say something along the lines:
%
The dynamic optimizations facilitated through \nrb\
\chdescs\ implement the efficiency in systems using soft updates or
journaling\todo{Actually do this for journaling} while expressing
changes modularly through structural descriptions rather than through
internal and semantic file system descriptions.

\todo{Should we talk about why we allow NRBs and merging to be
  disabled? (Debugging simplicity and depend add to \noop\ \chdescs\
  with \afters\ bug catching.)}
