\subsection{\Nrb\ \Patch\ Merging}
\label{sec:patch:merge}

File operations such as block allocations, inode updates, and directory updates
create many distinct \patches. Keeping track of these
\patches\ and their dependencies requires memory and
CPU time.
%
\Kudos\ therefore \emph{merges} \patches\ when possible, drastically reducing
\patch\ counts and memory usage, by conservatively identifying when a
new \patch\ could always be written at the same time as an existing \patch.
%
Rather than creating a new \patch\ in this case, \Kudos\ updates data
and dependencies to merge the new \patch\ into the existing one.


Two types of patch merging involve hard patches, and the first is trivial
to explain:
%
since all of a block's \nrb\ \patches\ \emph{must} be written at the same
time, they can \emph{always} be merged.
%
\Kudos\ ensures that each block contains at most one \nrb\ \patch.
%
If a new patch $p$ could be created as \nrb\ and $p$'s
block already contains a \nrb\ \patch\ $h$, then
%
the implementation merges $p$ into $h$ by applying $p$'s data to the block
and setting $\PDDepset{h} \gets \PDDepset{h} \cup \PDDepset{p}$.
%
% Steve is right: we don't mention callers anywhere before this
%% The existing \nrb\ \patch\ $h$ is returned to the caller.
%
This changes $h$'s direct dependency set after $h$ was created, but
since $p$ could have been created \nrb, the change cannot introduce any new
block-level cycles.
%
Unfortunately, the merge can create \emph{intra}-block cycles:
%
if some \noop\ \patch\ $e$ has $p \PDepend e \PDepend h$, then after
the merge $h \PDepend e \PDepend h$.
%
\Kudos\ detects and prunes any cyclic
dependencies during the merge.
%
\Nrb\ \patch\ merging is able to eliminate 8 of the \patches\ in our running
example, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:opt}c.


Second, \Featherstitch\ detects when a new \nrb\ patch can be merged with
 a block's existing \emph{\rb} \patches.
%
Block-level cycles may force a patch $p$ to be created as soft.
%
Once those cycles are broken (because the relevant patches commit), $p$
 could be converted to hard; but to avoid unnecessary work,
%
\Kudos\ delays the conversion, performing it only when it detects that a
 new patch on $p$'s block could be created \nrb.
%
Figure~\ref{f:soft2hard} demonstrates this using soft
 updates-like dependencies.
%
Consider a new \nrb\ \patch\ $h$ added to a block that
contains some \rb\ \patch\ $p$.
%
Since $h$ is considered to overlap $p$, \Kudos\ adds a direct dependency
$h \PDDepend p$.
%
Since $h$ could be \nrb\ even including this overlap dependency, we know
there are no block-level cycles with head $h$.
%
But as a result, we know that there are no block-level cycles
with head $p$, and
%
$p$ can be transformed into a \nrb\ \patch.  \Kudos\ will make $p$
hard by dropping its undo data, then merge $h$ into $p$.
%
Although this type of merging is not very common in practice, it is
 necessary to preserve useful invariants, such as that no hard patch has a
 dependency on the same block.

\begin{comment}

\Kudos\ includes three distinct \patch\ merge algorithms.
%
All three use Invariant~\ref{cdinvar:add-before} to reason about future
graph changes and use fast, conservative checks during \patch\ creation;
they differ in their applicable conditions.


\subsubsection{\Nrb\ \Patch\ Merging}
\label{sec:patches:merge:nrb}

Recall from Section~\ref{sec:patches:nrb} that a write of any \patches\ on
block $b$ must include all \nrb\ \patches\ on $b$.
%
This additional requirement is in fact an exquisite optimization
opportunity; it implies that all \nrb\ \patches\ on a given block can
be merged.
%
Further, merging can remove the need for the \nrb\ \patch\ implicit
dependency rules by ensuring that
%
there is at most one \nrb\ \patch\ per block (\nrb-\nrb\ merging)
%
and that all \rb\ \patches\ on a given block depend on the \nrb\ \patch\
(\nrb-\rb\ merging).
%
We describe these two \patch\ merging algorithms and how they
preserve dependency semantics in this section.

\paragraph{\Nrb-\Nrb\ \Patch\ Merging}
\label{sec:patches:merge:nrb:hard-hard}

\emph{\Nrb-\nrb\ \patch\ merging} merges a new \nrb\ \patch\ \p{q}
into an existing \nrb\ \patch\ \p{p} instead of creating \p{q}.
%
Any two \nrb\ \patches\ on the same block may be (and are) merged.
%
Merging all \nrb\ \patches\ ensures:
%
\cdinvar{one-nrb}{\(\forall\! b\!: |\PHard[b]| \leq 1\)}
%
\noindent
%
Invariant~\ref{cdinvar:one-nrb} simplifies \nrb\ \patch\ handling by
%
removing the implicit dependencies that ensure all \nrb\ \patches\
are written together
%
and by removing the need to scan for an existing \nrb\ \patch\ when
\nrb-\nrb\ \patch\ merging.
%
% Although merging two \patches\ will not induce block-level dependency
% cycles, without sufficient care merging could induce \patch-level
% dependency cycles.  A trivial example is merging \p{q} into \p{p} when
% \p{q} has an explicit dependency on \p{p}; the combined \p{(p+q)}
% should not and need not depend on itself.
%
To preserve dependency semantics, the merged \p{(p+q)} must depend on
the union of \p{p} and \p{q}'s transitive \befores. Additionally, while the
\patches\ can be merged without forming a \patch-level dependency cycle,
the merge must ensure that it does not introduce a needless cycle, e.g.
through \anoop\ \patch\ \p{e} in \depends{q}{\depends{e}{p}}
\todo{Is cycle avoidance worth mentioning? Is this a good way to mention it?}.

From Invariant~\ref{cdinvar:add-before} and the \nrb\ \patch\
creation condition (no external \afters), the only possible
dependencies involving \p{p} and \p{q} are those shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:nrb-merge}\todo{Should we give these deductions or a
  flavor?}.
%
Notice, for example, that any \p{r} such that
\indirdepends{q}{\indirdepends{r}{p}} is \anoop\ \patch\todo{This is
  a strong statement. Expand on its implications?}.
%
Our algorithm to transform dependencies for \nrb-\nrb\ \patch\ merges
(Figure~\ref{algo:merge:hard-hard}) follows from these possible
dependencies.
%
It updates \p{p}'s transitive \befores\ to ensure
\(\PDepset{q}\todo{Incorrect! Only the true \patches.} \subseteq
\PDepset{p}\)\todo{Note that Invariant~\ref{cdinvar:add-before}
  ensures that \noop\ \patches\ reachable from \p{q} will not gain
  data \patch\ \befores?}\todo{Note that it only needs to move dependencies?}.

\begin{figure}[htb]

  \caption{Possible dependencies when merging \nrb\ \patch\ \p{q}
    into existing \nrb\ \patch\ \p{p}.}
  \label{fig:nrb-merge}
\end{figure}

\noindent Algorithm called on \p{q} and \p{p}:\\
Input: \patch\ \p{a} and existing \nrb\ \patch\ \p{p}.\\
Returns: whether \indirdepends{a}{p} exists. \(\forall\! \p{b}\!: \indirdepends{a}{b}\) and \notindirdepends{b}{p}, creates \indirdepends{p}{b}.

\begin{itemize}
\item If \p{a} is external, return ``no path to \p{p}.''
\item If \p{a} equals \p{p}, return ``path to \p{p}.''
\item Call self on \p{a} and \p{p}.
\item If \p{a} has no path to \p{p}, return ``no path to \p{p}.''
\item For each \p{a} \before\ \p{b}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If \p{b} has no path to \p{p}:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Move \p{b} from a \before\ of \p{a} to a \before\ of \p{p}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\Nrb-\Rb\ \Patch\ Merging}
\label{sec:patches:merge:nrb:hard-soft}

When creating the first \nrb\ \patch\ on a block, \emph{\nrb-\rb\
  \patch\ merging} merges all existing (\rb) \patches\ into the new
\nrb\ \patch.
%
Such an arrangement can arise through a combination of \patch\ creates
and block writes; 
%
for example, the block may first obtain an initial (\nrb{}) \patch,
%
then gain external \afters\ on its \patch,
%
accumulate additional (\rb{}) \patches,
%
write the subset of its \patches\ with external \afters\ (leaving some
\rb\ \patches\ on the block),
%
and then gain a \nrb\ \patch.
%
In addition to reducing the number of data \patches, \nrb-\rb\
\patch\ merging removes the second implicit \nrb\ \patch\
dependency, that \rb\ \patches\ not explicitly dependent on the
block's \nrb\ \patch\ implicitly depend on it.
%
As in \nrb-\nrb\ \patch\ merging, \Kudos\ merges such \patches\ to
avoid the complications of their implicit dependencies.

\Nrb-\rb\ \patch\ merging's implementation first merges all \rb\ \patches\
into a \nrb\ \patch\ and then \nrb-\nrb\ \patch\ merges the new \nrb\
\patch\ into the now-existing \nrb\ \patch.
%
Our algorithm to transform the dependencies for \nrb-\rb\ \patch\
merges (Figure~\ref{algo:merge:hard-soft}) for block $b$
%
chooses a \patch\ \p{p} such that
\(\notexists \inset{q}{\PMem[b]}\!: \indirdepends{p}{q}\)
%
and updates its transitive \befores\ to ensure
\(\PDepset{\PSoft[b]} \subseteq \PDepset{p}\).
%
Because any \(\inset{q}{\PMem[b] - p}\) may have \afters, to
preserve dependencies we convert such a \p{q} into \anoop\ \patch\
and ensure \depends{q}{p}.

\noindent Algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
\item Choose a \(\inset{p}{\PMem[b]}\!:\
\notexists\! \inset{q}{\PMem[b]}\!:\ \indirdepends{p}{q}\).
\item For each \inset{q}{\PMem[b] - p}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Call the \nrb-\nrb\ \before\ move algorithm on \p{q} and \p{p}.
  \item Convert \p{q} into \anoop\ \patch.
  \end{itemize}
\item Convert \p{p} into a \nrb\ \patch\ (free it's previous data copy).
\end{itemize}

\todo{Note that \nrb-\rb\ merging is rare? Note why it is helpful even though
it is rare?}
\todo{Explain why this preserves dependency semantics? Show possible
dependencies? For the paper, free \patches\ instead of convert them
into \noop{}s? (Must modify \nrb-\nrb\ algo usage.)}

\end{comment}


\subsection{Overlap Merging}
\label{sec:patches:merge:overlap}

The final type of merging combines \rb\ \patches\ with other \patches,
\nrb\ or \rb, when they overlap.
%
Metadata blocks, such as bitmap blocks, inodes, and directory data, tend to
accumulate many nearby and overlapping \patches\ as the file system
gradually changes; for instance, Figure~\ref{f:opt}'s $i_1$--$i_4$ all
affect the same inode field.
%
Even data blocks can collect overlapping dependencies. Figure~\ref{f:opt}'s
 data writes $d'_n$ overlap, and therefore depend on, the initialization
 writes $d_n$---but
%
our heuristic cannot make $d'_n$ \nrb\ since when they are created,
 dependencies exist from the inode block onto $d_n$.
%
Overlap merging can combine these, and many other, mergeable patches,
further reducing \patch\ and undo data overhead.


Overlapping \patches\ $p_1$ and $p_2$, with $p_2 \PDepend p_1$, may be
merged \emph{unless} future patches and dependencies might
force the buffer cache to undo $p_2$, but not $p_1$.
%
Reusing the reasoning developed for \nrb\ \patches, we can carve out a
class of \patches\ that will never cause this problem:
%
if $p_2$ is not the head of a block-level cycle containing $p_1$,
then $p_2$ and $p_1$ can always be committed together.

To detect mergeable pairs, the \Kudos\ implementation again uses a
conservative heuristic that detects many pairs while limiting the
cost of traversing dependency graphs.
%
However, while the hard patch heuristic is both simple and effective, the heuristic
for overlap merging has required some tuning to balance CPU expense and
missed merge opportunities.
%
The current version examines all dependency chains of uncommitted patches
starting at $p_2$.  It succeeds if $p_1$ is not in any of the chains,
failing conservatively if any of the chains grows too long (more than 10
links) or there are too many chains.  
%
(It also simplifies the implementation to fail when $p_2$
overlaps with two or more soft patches that do not themselves overlap.)
%
However, some chains cannot induce block-level cycles and are allowed
regardless of how long they grow.
%
Consider a chain $p_2 \PDepend x$ not containing $p_1$.
%
If $p_1 \PDepend x$ as well, then since there are no circular dependencies, 
any continuation of the chain $p_2 \PDepend x$ will never encounter $p_1$.
%
Our heuristic white-lists several such chains, including $p_2 \PDepend h$
where $h$ is a hard patch on $p_1$'s block.
%
%% We tuned the heuristic to cope with
%% long dependency chains created by the Andrew benchmark on soft updates-like
%% dependencies.
%
\begin{comment}

It checks that every path starting at $p_1$ fits at least one of the
following cases:

%
If all chains fit, then there are no block-level cycles from $p_2$
to $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_1$ can have the same lifetime, and $p_2$ can be
merged into $p_1$ to create a combined patch.

, and to limit $p \PDDepend q$ existence checks to just $p$'s
and $q$'s two oldest and newest dependencies.
%
The rules to overlap merge two bit \patches\ are similar.
\end{comment}



In our running example, overlap merging combines all remaining
\rb\ \patches\ with their \nrb\ counterparts, reducing the number of \patches\
to the minimum of 8 and the amount of undo data to the minimum of 0.
%
In our experiments, \nrb\ \patches\ and our \patch\ merging
optimizations reduce the amount of memory allocated for undo data in
soft updates and journaling orderings by \patchoptundo.


\begin{comment}
%
If the only dependency between $p_1$ and $p_2$ is direct---that is, no path
$p_1 \PDepend x \PDepend p_2$ exists for any $x \not\in \{p_1,
p_2\}$---then it will always be possible to write $p_1$ and $p_2$ at the
same time.
%
Specifically, it is possible to write $p_1$ 


Many of these and similar \patches\ are mergeable and have
dependencies that allow simple (and fast) reasoning to identify many
of the mergeable pairs: two \patches\ on block $b$ that overlap no other \patches\ in \PMem[b]
and which have no dependency path from the new to the existing \patch\
will not induce a block-level cycle and so are writable together.
We know that \textit{later} changes will not cause them to induce a block-level cycle due to
invariant~\ref{cdinvar:add-before} and by not merging if the new \patch\
has a before and the before is marked as allowed to violate
invariant~\ref{cdinvar:add-before}.
%
While path existence testing is expensive, a conservative path test
of only a depth of two identifies most mergeable \patches. If the new
\patch\ has an explicit \before\ that is not the existing \patch\ and
this \before\ has a \before, then there may be a path to the existing
\patch.
%
To merge two such overlapping \patches, add the new \patch's explicit
before to the existing \patch\ (if any and if not the existing \patch).


%%

At the end of \patch\ optimizations, say something along the lines:
%
The dynamic optimizations facilitated through \nrb\
\patches\ implement the efficiency in systems using soft updates or
journaling\todo{Actually do this for journaling} while expressing
changes modularly through structural descriptions rather than through
internal and semantic file system descriptions.
