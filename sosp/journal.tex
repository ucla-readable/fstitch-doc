\paragraph{Journaling}
\label{sec:using:journal}

The \Kudos\ journal module sits below a regular file system and transforms
incoming \patches\ into journal transactions.
%
Data \patches\ are copied into the journal; a commit record depends on the
journal \patches; and the original file system \patches\ depend in turn on the
commit record.
%
The dependencies among the original \patches\ are removed since the journal
itself provides consistency for each high-level file system operation by
replaying outstanding transactions on recovery.
\footnote{However, it does take care to ensure that the user-specified
dependencies described in \S\ref{sec:patchgroup} are not violated.}
%
The journal format is similar to ext3's~\cite{tweedie98journaling}: a
transaction contains a list of block numbers, the data to be written to
those blocks, and finally a single commit record.
%
Note that the journal must modify existing \patches' direct dependencies;
this is allowed since the new dependencies will never introduce a
block-level cycle.

Like ext3, transactions are required to commit in sequence. Therefore the
journal \module\ sets each commit record to depend on the previous, and each
completion record to depend on the previous completion record. This allows
multiple outstanding transactions in the journal, which benefits performance,
but ensures that in the event of a crash, the journal will contain only
contiguous sequential transactions.

Since the commit record is created at the end of the transaction, the journal
\module\ uses a special \noop\ \patch\ explicitly held in memory to prevent
file system changes from being written to the disk until the transaction is
complete. This \noop\ \patch\ is set to depend on the previous transaction's
completion record, which prevents merging between transactions while allowing
merging within a transaction. This temporary dependency is removed when the
real commit record is created and its dependencies are set up as described
above.

%Due to this design, the journal \module\ is completely independent of any
%specific file system. It is a block device \module\ that automatically journals
%whatever file system is stored on it. In fact, the incoming \patches\ need not
%be arranged for soft updates, or for that matter in any particular configuration
%at all.

% Is it important to specify how we figure out where transaction boundaries
% are? It seemed confusing to one reviewer due to this section preceeding the
% modules section.

Our journal module prototype can run in full data journal mode, where every
updated block is written to the journal, or in metadata-only mode, where only
blocks containing file system metadata are written to the journal. It can
tell which blocks are which by looking for a special flag on each \patch.
