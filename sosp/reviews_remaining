Remaining:
- add more explanation for when hard patches cannot be applied?
- compare with exokernel (sosp 97)

Mostly took care of:
/ should we be more clear about goals of case studies?
	- should we state that gzip is safe with ordered ext3? why fsync is an inefficient solution?

Decided to not do:
/ should we evaluate gzip and subversion modifications?
/ perhaps add shadow paging as a consistency model
/ best way to compare: implement SU for Linux ext2 and compare
	- but: we now have journal perf numbers, so maybe this is less of an issue
/ compare perf with freebsd ufs with soft updates in text? (we said we might)
