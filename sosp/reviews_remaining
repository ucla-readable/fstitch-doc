- perhaps add shadow paging as a consistency model
- best way to compare: implement SU for Linux ext2 and compare
	- but: we now have journal perf numbers, so maybe this is less of an issue
- should we be more clear about goals of case studies?
	- should we state that gzip is safe with ordered ext3? why fsync is an inefficient solution?
- should we evaluate gzip and subversion modifications?
- add more explanation for when hard patches cannot be applied?
- compare with exokernel (sosp 97)
- compare perf with freebsd ufs with soft updates in text? (we said we might)
