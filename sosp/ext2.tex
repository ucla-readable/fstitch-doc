\subsection{ext2}
\label{sec:modules:ext2}

\Kudos\ currently has implementations of three base file system types: a simple
inode-less file system called JOSFS, Linux ext2, and 4.2 BSD UFS.

Yay! We support ext2! And, with the journal, pseudo-ext3!

Describe ext2 in more detail here, and simplify the UFS section.
