\section {Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
\label{eval}

We evaluate
%
the effectiveness of \patch\ optimizations,
%
the performance of the \Kudos\ implementation relative to Linux ext2
and ext3,
%
the correctness of the \Kudos\ implementation,
%
and the performance of \patchgroups.
%
This evaluation shows
%
that \patch\ optimizations significantly reduce \patch\ memory and CPU
requirements;
%
that a \Kudos\ \patch-based storage system has overall performance
that is within reason, even though it is slower than Linux in some
benchmarks;
%
that \Kudos\ file systems are consistent after system crashes;
%
and that a \patchgroup-enabled IMAP server performs as well as or
better than the unmodified server.

\subsection{Methodology}

All tests were run on a Dell Precision 380 with a 3.2~GHz Pentium 4
CPU, 2~GB of RAM, and a Seagate ST3320620AS 320~GB 7200~RPM SATA2 disk.
%
All tests use a 10~GB file system and the Linux 2.6.20.1 kernel
with the Ubuntu v6.06.1 distribution.
%
Because \Kudos\ is not aware of high memory we disable it for all
configurations, limiting the computer to 912~MB of RAM.
%
Only the PostMark benchmark is sensitive to this cache size limitation.

We examine Linux ext2 (in asynchronous mode) and ext3 (in writeback,
ordered, and full journal modes), and \Kudos\ ext2 (in asynchronous,
soft updates, metadata journal, and full journal modes), all created
with default configurations. All journaled file systems use a 64~MB
journal.

The three journal modes provide different consistency guarantees.
The strength of these guarantees is strictly ordered:
\vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}
\begin{center}
asynchronous $<$ writeback $<$ ordered $<$ full
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}
Writeback journaling commits metadata atomically and commits data only
after the corresponding metadata. \Kudos\ metadata journaling is
equivalent to ext3 writeback journaling.
%
Ordered journaling commits data associated with a given transaction
prior to the proceeding transaction's metadata, and is the most
commonly used ext3 journaling mode.
%
In all tests ext3 writeback and ordered journaling modes performed
similarly, and \Kudos\ does not implement ordered mode, so we report
only writeback results.
%
Full journaling commits data atomically.

There is a notable write durability difference between the default
\Kudos\ and Linux ext2/ext3 configurations: \Kudos\ safely presumes a write
is durable after it is on the disk platter, whereas Linux ext2 and
ext3 by default presume a write is durable once it reaches the disk cache. However, Linux can write
safely (by restricting the disk to providing only a write through
cache) and \Kudos\ can write unsafely (by disabling FUA).
%
We distinguish safe (e.g., FUA/write-through cache) from unsafe results
when comparing the systems.
%
All timing results are the mean over five runs.

To evaluate \patch\ optimizations and \Kudos\ as a whole we ran four
benchmarks.
%
The \emph{untar benchmark} untars and syncs the Linux 2.6.15 source code
from the cached file \texttt{linux-2.6.15.tar} (218~MB).
%
The \emph{delete benchmark}, after unmounting and remounting the file
system following the untar benchmark, deletes the result of the untar
benchmark and syncs.
%
The \emph{PostMark benchmark} emulates the small file workloads seen
on email and netnews servers~\cite{postmark}. We use PostMark v1.5,
configured to create 500 files ranging in size from 500~B to 4~MB;
perform 500 transactions consisting of file reads, writes, creates,
and deletes; delete its files; and finally sync.
%
The modified \emph{Andrew benchmark} emulates a software development
workload.  The benchmark creates a directory hierarchy, copies a
source tree, reads the extracted files, compiles the extracted files,
and syncs. The source code we use for the modified Andrew benchmark is
the Ion window manager, version 2-20040729.

\opttable{}

We evaluate the effectiveness of the \patch\ optimizations discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:patch:optimizations}, in terms of
%
the total number of \patches\ created, amount of undo data allocated,
and system CPU time used.
%
Figure~\ref{f:optdata} shows these results for the untar, delete,
PostMark, and Andrew benchmarks for \Kudos\ ext2 in soft updates mode,
with all combinations of using \nrb\ \patches\ and overlap merging.
%
The PostMark results for no optimizations and for just the \nrb\
\patches\ optimization use a smaller maximum \Kudos\ cache size,
80,000 blocks vs 160,000 blocks, so that the benchmark does not run
out of memory.
%
The results for metadata and full data journaling are similar.

Both optimizations work well alone, but their combination is particularly
effective at reducing the amount of undo data---which, again, is pure
overhead relative to conventional file systems.
%
Undo data memory usage is reduced by \patchoptundo,
%
the number of \patches\ created is reduced by \patchoptcount,
%
and system CPU time is reduced by up to 81\%.

}

We benchmark \Kudos\ and Linux ext2/ext3 for the untar, delete,
PostMark, and Andrew benchmarks. Results are listed in
Figure~\ref{fig:bench_time}.
%
The general result is that \Kudos\ performs comparably with Linux
ext2/ext3 when providing similar durability guarantees. Linux
ext2/ext3 sometimes outperforms \Kudos\ (particularly for journaling modes
and the PostMark test), and sometimes the reverse.

\benchtable{}

While \Kudos\ performs similarly for total time for the untar, delete,
and Andrew benchmarks, during the untar and delete \Kudos\ uses significantly
more CPU time than Linux ext2 or ext3 do---up to three times the CPU
time. \Kudos\ uses a similar amount of CPU time as Linux ext2 and ext3 for
the Andrew benchmark
%
Higher CPU requirements are an important concern and, despite much progress
in our optimization efforts, remain a weakness.
%
Some of the contributors to \Kudos\ CPU usage are inherent, such as
\patch\ creation, while others are artifacts of the current
implementation, such as creating a second copy of a block to write it to
disk; we have not separated these two categories.
%
%
\begin{comment}
Further, while \Kudos\ I/O times are lower than Linux ext2/ext3 I/O
times for the untar and delete benchmarks, we have found that small
block allocation strategy changes can significantly affect I/O time
for many of these benchmarks. This further emphasizes the importance
of the system CPU time difference.
\end{comment}

\begin{comment}
Unlike the untar, delete, and Andrew benchmarks, Linux ext3 writeback
and journal modes outperform \Kudos\ meta journal and full journal
modes, respectively, at PostMark.
\end{comment}

%This demonstrates that the overhead of using \patches\ in \Kudos\ is not
%entirely unreasonable, but has room for significant improvement.

\subsection {Correctness}
\label{sec:eval:correctness}

In order to check that we had implemented the journaling and soft updates
rules correctly,
we implemented a \Kudos\ module which crashes the operating system, without
giving it a chance to synchronize its buffers, at a random time during each
run.
%
In \Kudos\ asynchronous mode, after crashing, fsck nearly always reported
that the file system contained many references to inodes that had been
deleted, among other errors: the file system was corrupt.
%
With our soft updates dependencies, the file system was always soft update
consistent: fsck reported that inode reference counts were higher than the
correct values (an expected discrepancy after a soft updates crash).
%
With journaling, fsck always reported that the file system was
consistent after the journal replay.

\subsection {\Patchgroups}
\label{sec:evaluation:uwimap}

% #reviewers who want measurements of all case studies: 1
% #reviewers who want measurements of at least svn and imap studies: 2

We evaluate the performance of the \patchgroup-enabled UW IMAP mail
server (\S\ref{sec:patchgroup:uwimap}) by benchmarking moving 1,000
messages from one folder to another.
%
To move the messages, the client selects the source mailbox (containing
1,000 2~kB messages), creates a new mailbox, copies each message to
the new mailbox and marks each source message for deletion, expunges
the marked messages, commits the mailboxes, and logs out.

Figure~\ref{fig:imap-compare} shows the results for safe file system
configurations,
%
reporting total time, system CPU time, and the number of disk write
requests (an indicator of the number of required seeks in safe
configurations).
%
We benchmark
%
\Kudos\ and Linux with the unmodified server (sync after each message
copy),
%
\Kudos\ with the \patchgroup-enabled server (sync only at the end),
%
and Linux and \Kudos\ with the server modified to assume and take
advantage of fully journaled file systems (changes are effectively
committed linearly, so sync only at the end).

Figure~\ref{fig:imap-compare} lists only safe configurations; unsafe
\Kudos\ and Linux configurations complete in about 1.5~seconds.
%
\Kudos\ meta and full journal modes perform similarly so we report
only for the full journal mode.
%
Linux ext3 writeback, ordered, and full journal modes also perform similarly,
so we report only for the full journal mode.
%
Using the linear consistency method with \Kudos\ full journaling performs
similarly to the corresponding case with Linux full journaling.

Fully journaled \Kudos\ with \patchgroups\ performs at least as well
as all other (safe and unsafe) \Kudos\ and all Linux configurations.
It is 11--13 times faster than safe Linux ext3 with the unmodified
server.
%
Using the linear consistency method with \Kudos\ and Linux, the IMAP
server performs similarly to the \patchgroup\ consistency method with
\Kudos. However, the linear consistency method requires the underlying
file system use full data journaling.

\Kudos\ in soft updates mode with \patchgroups\ is significantly
slower than \Kudos\ in journal modes. As the number of write requests
indicate, each of soft updates mode's \patchgroups\ require multiple
write requests (e.g. to update the destination mailbox and the
destination mailbox's modification time). In contrast, journaling is
able to commit a large number of copies atomically, using only a small
constant number of requests.
%
\Kudos\ with the unmodified server makes significantly many more
requests than Linux ext3; we believe this is due to \Kudos\ also
committing file system summary information that Linux does not commit
for the \texttt{fsync} system call. \Kudos\ with \patchgroups\
also currently has this limitation.

\subsection{Summary}
\label{sec:evaluation:summary}

We find
%
that our optimizations greatly reduce system overheads, including
undo data and system CPU time;
%
that \Kudos\ obtains reasonable performance on several benchmarks,
comparable with Linux in most cases despite the additional effort required
to maintain patches;
%
that CPU time remains an optimization opportunity;
%
that applications can effectively define consistency requirements with
\patchgroups\ that apply to many file systems;
%
and that the \Kudos\ implementation correctly
implements soft updates and journaling consistency.
%
Our results are encouraging, indicating that even a patch-based prototype
can implement different consistency models with reasonable cost.
