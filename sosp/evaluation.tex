\section {Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

We evaluate our prototype implementation of \Kudos\ in two ways: first, we
show that the overall performance is within reason, even though it is slower
than Linux or BSD by a nontrivial amount. We justify this difference, and argue
that it can be improved substantially. Second, we show specific block write
orderings in a variety of situations, demonstrating the effect and utility of
\opgroups\ and the potential for them to improve the efficiency of applications
using them. All tests were run on a Dell Precision 380 with a 3.2GHz Pentium 4
CPU, 2GB of RAM, and a Seagate ST3320620AS 320GB 7200RPM SATA2 disk, using 10GB
file systems.
%
All tests use a 10 GB file system.
%
Our tests use Linux 2.6.20.1 with ext2 and ext3, \Kudos\ with ext2, and
FreeBSD 6.0 with UFS in soft updates mode, all created with default
configurations.

We have two tests which are repeated throughout this section: first, we untar
the Linux 2.6.15 source code from \texttt{linux-2.6.15.tar} (218 MB), which is
already decompressed and cached in RAM. Second, we delete the resulting source
tree, after unmounting and remounting the file system.

\subsection {Optimization Benefits}

\Kudos\ benefits greatly from the optimizations discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:patch:optimizations}. The total number of \chdescs\ created,
amount of rollback data allocated, and system CPU time used are shown for the
untar and rm tests in Figure~\ref{f:optdata}, with all combinations of using
\nrb\ \chdescs\ and overlap merging. While both optimizations work well by
themselves, the combination of the two is particularly effective at reducing the
amount of rollback data.

\subsection {Microbenchmarks}
We have also looked at the number of block writes that \Kudos\ makes
relative to other systems for several operations. In one test, we
create 100 small files in a directory and measure the number of blocks
written to disk. We do this with and without soft updates. \Kudos\
writes 122 blocks, while FreeBSD writes 135 blocks.

Another test pits Linux ext2 and ext3 against \Kudos\ ext2 with soft updates,
when extracting a large archive. Linux ext2 writes 523,248 blocks; Linux ext3
writes 523,192; \Kudos\ writes 540,472.

We also look at a very small benchmark: removing a file from a
directory and adding a new file to it. We compare the number of blocks
written by \Kudos\ with that of FreeBSD using soft updates. Here
\Kudos\ writes 15 blocks, while FreeBSD writes 83 blocks.

We ran the two small benchmarks with the journal module, in full
data journaling mode. Creating 100 small files with the journal
resulted in 245 blocks written to the disk, but only 126 blocks
without the journal. Deleting and adding a file resulted in writing
31 with the journal module and 18 without it.

\label{fig:postmark}
\end{figure}

\Kudos\ is about 21\% faster than FreeBSD using soft updates for
writes, and about 41\% faster for deletions.\footnote{Interestingly, FreeBSD 5.4
performs better than version 6.0 at these tests, particularly the delete test,
but \Kudos\ is still faster than the untar test.}
%
When compared to Linux ext3, \Kudos\ is about 32\% slower for writes, but many
times slower for deletions.
%
This demonstrates that the overhead of using \chdescs\ in \Kudos\ is not
entirely unreasonable, but has room for significant improvement.
%
\todo{Reference and discuss Figure~\ref{fig:postmark}.}
%
While \Kudos\ does still have some CPU usage and I/O delay problems, its
performance has been steadily improving over time and we expect that it will
continue to improve as we optimize it further.
%
There are more optimization opportunities that can likely bring us much closer
in performance to Linux. (A major cause of the slow delete performance is writing
updates to blocks which have been freed, which we have a plan to optimize.)

\subsubsection {UW IMAP Case Study}
\label{sec:evaluation:uwimap}
To assess the \opgroup-enabled UW IMAP mail server
(\S\ref{sec:opgroup:uwimap}) we compare the number of block writes
that \Kudos\ makes relative to FreeBSD to move 100 emails. The test
selects the source mailbox (with 100 messages, sized 2kB each),
creates the new mailbox, copies each of the 100 messages to the new
mailbox, marks each source message for deletion, expunges the marked
messages, requests a check, and logs out. We compare using soft updates;
Figure~\ref{fig:imap-compare} shows the results.
