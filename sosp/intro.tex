This paper aims to evaluate whether a simple, unified abstraction that
explicitly represents both a ``write before'' relationship among
buffered changes to stable storage, as well as the changes themselves,
can be used to efficiently implement a complete file system layer, where
modifications are common and cache sizes are large.
%
The answer is a qualified yes.


As file system functionality increases, file system correctness is
 increasingly a focus of
 research~\cite{sivathanuetal05-logic,denehyetal05-journal-guided}.
%
File systems must commit blocks to stable storage in an order that
 preserves file system correctness.
%
This is difficult enough for file system
 implementers~\cite{tweedie98journaling,mckusick99soft}, but further
 complicated by file system extensions and special disk interfaces~\cite{soules03metadata,fast04versionfs,quinlan02venti,cornell04wayback,wright03ncryptfs,sivathanu03semantically-smart,sivathanu05database-aware}.
%
Although stackable file
 systems~\cite{zadok00fist,zadok99extending,heidemann94filesystem,rosenthal90evolving}
 %% can aid in preserving consistency by 
 place extensions over an existing file system responsible for maintaining
 consistency, some extensions---for instance, creating a file containing
 metadata information about a directory---can introduce ordering
 requirements difficult to express at the VFS layer.
%
This problem exists for applications as well.
%
The expensive \texttt{fsync} and \texttt{sync} system calls are the only
 tools available for enforcing file consistency.
%
Robust applications, including databases, mail servers, and source code
 management tools, either accept the performance penalty of these system
 calls or rely on specialized raw-disk interfaces.


Proposed systems for improving file system integrity and consistency differ
 mainly in the kind of consistency they aim to impose, ranging from
 metadata consistency to full data journaling
 and even full ACID
 transactions~\cite{gal05transactional,liskov04transactional}.
%
However, different extensions within a file system, or different
 applications over the file system, may require different types of
 consistency semantics, and performance suffers when lower layers are
 unnecessarily denied the opportunity to reorder writes.
%
A better choice might be an abstraction that can express many consistency
 models.


This work develops a new fundamental data type called a \emph{\patch},
 which represents both a change to disk data and any \emph{dependencies}
 between that change and other changes. 
%
\Patches\ were inspired by the dependency abstraction from BSD's soft
 updates~\cite{ganger00soft}, but whereas the soft updates implementation
 involves many structures specific to the UFS file
 system~\cite{mckusick99soft}, \patches\ are fully general,
 specifying only how a range of bytes should be changed.
%
This lets file system implementations specify \emph{what} the desired
 write before relationship is between the changes without dictating (or
 worrying about) \emph{how} to write blocks to stable storage to implement
 that policy, and it lets other storage system modules examine and
 modify dependency structures independent of the file system's layout.


Additionally, we present a user-level interface called \patchgroups,
 which provides applications with controlled access to \patches---allowing
 them to impose their own limited consistency policies for the storage
 system to follow.
%
Modifying an IMAP mail server to use this interface requires only localized
 changes; the resulting server follows IMAP's consistency requirements
 while writing fewer blocks to disk. \todo{update this claim}


\Patches\ can implement many consistency mechanisms, including
 soft updates and journaling.
%
Our file system modules impose soft updates-style \patch\ requirements by
 default, since doing so requires some knowledge of the file system's
 structures; we have also written a journal module that can change
 existing dependencies to express either full or metadata-only journaling.
%
A file system module not interested in supporting soft updates support
 could instead impose no \patch\ requirements, and count on the journal
 module to provide a consistency guarantee.


The \Kudos\ storage system implementation is decomposed entirely into
 pluggable \modules\ that manipulate \patches, hopefully making the system
 as a whole more configurable, extensible, and easier to understand.
%
Any storage system \module\ can generate \patches; other modules can examine
 them and modify them when required.
%
\Patch\ dependencies are obeyed by all other storage system layers, allowing
 them to be passed through layers such as loopback block devices.
%
As a result, the loosely-coupled \modules\ that implement a file system
 can cooperate to enforce strong and often complex consistency guarantees,
 even though each \module\ only does a small part of the work.


This generality comes at a cost, but that cost can be partially mitigated.
%
Real file system implementations achieve consistency and write before
 relationships without sacrificing performance by using a variety of file
 system specific optimizations.
%
We found that a naive implementation using \patches\ scaled terribly,
 spending far more space and time on dependency manipulation than
 conventional systems.
%
We therefore developed a variety of dynamic optimizations that
 significantly reduce the memory and CPU overhead associated with \patches.


Our contributions include the generalized \patch\ design, the
 optimizations we have developed for making \patches\ more efficient,
 the formal model of \patches, the \patchgroup\ mechanism that exports
 \patches\ to user space, the \module\ interfaces in our \Kudos\
 prototype, and several of the individual \Kudos\ \modules\ like the
 journal.


We describe \patches\ abstractly, state their behavior and safety
 properties, and reason about the correctness of our optimizations.
%
Finally, we demonstrate a prototype file system implementation using
 \patches\ called \Kudos.
%
For an untar-Linux benchmark that writes 253~MB of data, our optimizations
 can reduce the number of \patches\ created by half and the amount of
 undo data memory required by 99.73\%. 
%
Our prototype is not yet as fast as we would like, but it is competitive
 with Linux on many of our benchmarks.
