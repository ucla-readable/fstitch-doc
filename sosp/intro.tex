\section {Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


This paper aims to evaluate whether a simple, unified abstraction that
represents all modifications to stable storage, including
\emph{dependencies} among modifications, can be used to efficiently
implement a complete file system layer, where modifications are common
and cache sizes are large.
%
The answer is a qualified yes.


As file system functionality increases, file system correctness is
 increasingly a focus of
 research~\cite{sivathanuetal05-logic,denehyetal05-journal-guided}.
%
File systems must commit blocks to stable storage in an order that
 preserves file system correctness.
%
This is difficult enough for file system
 implementers~\cite{tweedie98journaling,mckusick99soft}, but further
 complicated by file system extensions and special disk interfaces~\cite{soules03metadata,fast04versionfs,quinlan02venti,cornell04wayback,wright03ncryptfs,sivathanu03semantically-smart,sivathanu05database-aware}.
%
Although stackable file
 systems~\cite{zadok00fist,zadok99extending,heidemann94filesystem,rosenthal90evolving}
 %% can aid in preserving consistency by 
 place extensions over an existing file system responsible for maintaining
 consistency, some extensions---for instance, creating a file containing
 metadata information about a directory---can introduce ordering
 requirements difficult to express at the VFS layer.
%
This problem exists for applications as well.
%
The expensive \texttt{fsync} and \texttt{sync} system calls are the only
 tools available for enforcing file consistency.
%
Robust applications, including databases, mail servers, and source code
 management tools, either accept the performance penalty of these system
 calls or rely on specialized raw-disk interfaces.


Proposed systems for improving file system integrity and consistency differ
 mainly in the kind of consistency they aim to impose, ranging from
 metadata consistency to full data journaling
 and even full ACID
 transactions~\cite{gal05transactional,liskov04transactional}.
%
However, different extensions within a file system, or different
 applications over the file system, may require different types of
 consistency semantics, and performance suffers when lower layers are
 unnecessarily denied the opportunity to reorder
 writes.
%
A better choice might be an abstraction that can express many consistency
 models.


This work develops a new fundamental data type called a \emph{\patch},
 which represents both a change to disk data and any \emph{dependencies}
 between that change and other changes. 
%
\Patches\ were inspired by the dependency abstraction from BSD's soft
 updates~\cite{ganger00soft}, but whereas the soft updates implementation
 involves many structures specific to the UFS file
 system~\cite{mckusick99soft}, \patches\ are fully general,
 specifying only how a range of bytes should be changed.
%
This lets file system implementations and extensions examine and modify
 dependency structures independent of the file system's layout.


\Patches\ can implement many consistency mechanisms, including
 soft updates and journaling.
%
Our file system modules impose soft updates-style \patch\
 requirements by default; we have also written a journal module that
 can change those dependencies to express either full or metadata-only
 journaling.
%
Additionally, we give user-level applications controlled access to \patches,
allowing applications to impose their own limited consistency
 policies.
%
Modifying an IMAP mail server to use this interface requires only localized
 changes; the resulting server follows IMAP's consistency
 requirements while writing fewer blocks to disk. % FIXME is this still true?


The \Kudos\ storage system implementation is decomposed entirely into
 pluggable \modules\ that manipulate \patches, hopefully making the system
 as a whole more configurable, extensible, and easier to understand.
%
Any storage system \module\ can generate \patches; other modules can examine
 them and modify them when required.
%
\Patch\ dependencies are obeyed by all other storage system layers, allowing
 them to be passed through layers such as loopback block devices.
%
As a result, the loosely-coupled \modules\ that implement a file system
 can cooperate to enforce strong and often complex consistency guarantees,
 even though each \module\ only does a small part of the work.


This generality comes at a cost, but that cost can be partially mitigated.
%
Real file system implementations achieve consistency and write ordering
 relationships without sacrificing performance by using a variety of file
 system specific optimizations.
%
We found that a naive implementation using \patches\ scaled terribly,
 spending far more space and time on dependency manipulation than
 conventional systems.
%
We therefore developed a variety of dynamic optimizations that
 significantly reduce the memory and CPU overhead associated with \patches.


Our contributions include the generalized \patch\ design, the
 optimizations we have developed for making \patches\ more efficient,
 the formal model of \patches, the \module\ interfaces in our \Kudos\
 prototype, several of the individual \Kudos\ \modules\ like the journal,
 and the \patchgroup\ mechanism that exports \patches\ to user space.


We describe \patches\ abstractly, state their behavior and safety
 properties, and reason about the correctness of our optimizations.
%
Finally, we demonstrate a prototype file system implementation using
 \patches\ called \Kudos.
%
For an untar-Linux benchmark that writes 253~MB of data, our optimizations
 can reduce the number of \patches\ created by half and the amount of
 rollback data memory required by 99.73\%. 
%
Our prototype is not yet as fast as we would like, but it is competitive
 with Linux on many of our benchmarks.
