Improve system name?

Modules:
- Explore modules not possible within a stackable file system (osdi reviewer)

Opgroups:
- Improve imap evaluation re reviews?
  - Add macro benchmarks
- Compare data journaling (unnecessarily strict) vs minimal opgroups
- Do svn+opgroups crash test?
- Figure out: how does MacOSX HFS+ journaling work?

Implementation:
- Note that the current implementation stores two copies of each block

Related work:
- Linux 2.6.17 sync_file_range range system call
- fdatasync?
- ext2?

Misc:
- Look at BSD implementation of soft updates; how does it work?
- Check that we did not forget any todos sent to kudos@ 


* Kudos

- Decrease cpu usage
  - Update wb cache to traverse only ready and clean block lists
  - Track down what uses cpu time
- Ensure correct directory ordering (delete a; touch a)
- Decrease dependency memory usage?
- Make journal module's meta mode preserve patchgroup dependencies?
- Import linux ext2 allocator?
- Add patch undo?
	- On hold because it needs dependency count tracking?
- Add more consistency modules?


* Benchmarking

- Try benchmarks with larger cache
- Add another standard benchmark
- Start running correctness tests?
- Add SU to Linux ext2?
- Measure imap benchmark
- Add gzip benchmark
- Add svn benchmark
- Track other patch-related datastructure memory usage?
  - bit overlap hash maps
  - number of hard patches
