Refocus paper
Review OSDI reviews
- common general feedback: "I cannot tell whether kudos reached its goals"

Abstract/Intro:
- One reviewer did not understand the paper until Conclusion's first sentence.
  Add a sentence like it to the paper's start?
	"Kudos provides a new way for file system implementations to
	formalize write ordering requirements, allowing such software to be
	divided into modules which cooperate loosely to implement strong
	consistency guarantees."

Modules:
- Explore modules not possible within a stackable file system (reviewer)

Opgroups:
- Improve imap evaluation re reviews?
  - Add macro benchmarks
- Compare data journaling (unnecessarily strict) vs minimal opgroups
- Do svn+opgroups crash test?
- Figure out: how does MacOSX HFS+ journaling work?

Implementation:
- Get us to pass fsck.ext2?

Evaluation:
- Show how patches make file system writing simpler? (One reviewer asked?)
- Understand and describe why re our current numbers
- Improve our current numbers
  - Are unnecessarily strict dependencies hurting speed?
  - Should we improve our disk write notification usage?

Misc:
- look at BSD implementation of soft updates; how does it work?
- ufs implementation becomes a diagram


ACM wants us to show that we:
* are attacking a significant problem,
* have devised an interesting, compelling solution,
* have demonstrated the practicality and benefits of the solution,
* have drawn appropriate conclusions,
* have clearly described what they have done, and
* have clearly articulated the advances beyond previous work.
