Descriptions of, notes on, and hashing outs of journaling


* Non-intra-BD Cycles

** Problem

In developing the remove_inter_ddesc_deps algorithm, this problem came up: Say
you have BDs B1 (a journal_bd) and B2 (an external BD) and chdescs with deps
C1@B1 -> C3@B2 -> C2@B1. Since journaling will commit all its chdescs in one
journal transaction (really: it will commit them one at a time, in the event
of a crash an entire transaction will be replayed). We can replace C1 and C2
with the commit record for their transaction: CR -> C3 -> CR, but this creates
a cycle. Horrors!

Can this scenario actually happen in practice? Chris can see a raid over loop
over journaled fses example.

** Solutions

A solution is to not change C1 and C2 to their CR. This means recovery may not
correctly recover as far as inter-BDs are concerned, but intra-BD consistency
will be maintained and no cycles will exist at runtime. We could write a tool
to detect such configurations and warn the user. Eddie suggests this route.

If multiple BDs were journaled together, we could solve this problem.  This
would make journal's on-disk format and recovery more complicated.

If we were to ensure C1 and C2 were in separate transactions this cycle could
not occur. However, our current idea of journaling does not allow intra-CFS
call transaction segmentation. For example, separating a block alloc and block
ptr creation would mean that the allocated block could be lost if there was a
crash inbetween the two transactions. Softupdates does allow this, but it must
scan the disk for such inconsistencies, whereas traditional journaling does
not have this problem.


* The bdesc and chdesc graph

journal_graph.dia: a transactions' bdesc and chdesc graph.


* How to produce the graph
Divided into journal_bd's state struct and methods:

journal_state:
* bd and journalBd
* chdesc CR
* chdesc CRInvalidate
* map "blockMap" blockno->list(chdescs)
* set externDeps of chdescs
* chdescs externDeps, journalDataDeps, externDepsAndJounalDataDeps, fsDataDeps

write_block(block):
- remove intra-bd, inter-ddesc deps from fsdata chdescs
  (see "** remove_inter_ddesc_deps algorithm")
  [not necessary. we can do this later for possible optimization]
- if blockno not yet in blockMap, add it
- for each chdescs in block on this bd:
  - add them to this blockno's blockMap list
  - add a dependency on CR
  - add a dependent on fsDataDeps
- write_block() to below bd

transaction_stop():
- for each list in blockMap:
  - synth_read() the journal data block  
  - for each chdesc in list:
    - move external deps (inter-bd and "rolled-back intra-bd") from chdesc to externDeps
    - copy chdesc to the journal data block
    - make journalDataDeps depend on the copied chdesc
      (optimiation: if there exists A->B on some block, we need only make A dep
       on CR head)
- write "block nos", the journal data blocks, and CRInvalidate to journalBd
  - "block nos" could include an iterator (for correct inter-transaction 
     replay) as the first/last entry. simple and seems to cover the needs.

transaction_start():
- create externDeps and journalDataDeps chdescs
- create externDepsAndJounalDataDeps chdesc, depend on externDeps and jDD
- create fsDataDeps
- create CR, depend on fsDataDeps
  - to ensure inter-transaction dependencies are preserved (note: no cycles
    are allowed to exist), we could make CR_{i+1} depend on CR_{i}. to give
    scheduling more freedom we could look through the inter-trans deps and
    create inter-CR deps on for those trans that have deps.


** remove_inter_ddesc_deps algorithm

Ask Chris to checkin. (Why it's not checked in yet: it was being
written when "Non-intra-BD Cycles" was thought of.)


* Journaling could allow cycles above it

Thinking about "Non-intra-BD Cycles", it seems we might be able to allow
dependency cycles on top of a journaled fs. We do not allow cyclic
dependencies because we can atomically commit but a single block. However,
journaling could allow cyclic dependencies above it

Might there be any interesting uses for cycles? This would probably allow for
more flexibility, since transactions could then not be restricted to a
sequence of chdescs (eg you could build two separate transactions during
overlapping periods). I think finding uses inside kfsd would be helpful, but
outside of kfsd, perhaps applications could take advantage of this so that
they would not have to implement their own transaction support. This could
also help remove their dependence on a particular block size.


* Known artificial flavor bugs to fix in corn syrup

- On disk transaction format needs inter-transaction deps.
  It is seems reasonable to simply give each transaction a monotonic id
  and replay in order.
- Was there a second bug?
